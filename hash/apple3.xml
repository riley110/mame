	BOOTABLE?: Bootable

	CustomFONT is a wonderful font-creation program that has been
	placed into the PD by Swenson Associates.  It will allow the user to
	create or adapt Apple /// character sets and even has drivers allowing
	the user to print out the custom-created fonts!

	CustomFONT allows you to manipulate and customize the letters, numerals
	and symbols used by your Apple ///.  Character "sets" are stored on disk in
	data files called "fontfiles."  The fontfile used by the Apple /// is called
	"system character set" and is contained in the file named "SOS.DRIVER" on any
	boot (start-up) diskette like AppleWriter ///, Business Basic, Pascal, Draw
	On Three and others. In order to use customized fontfiles in an application,
	you must first use CustomFONT to create the customized fontfile and then use
	the Apple /// System Utilities to modify your application boot diskette,
	specifying that a new fontfile is to be used as the "system character set".
	Fontfile customization is discussed in Chapters 4 though 8, and the Apple ///
	System Utilities are discussed in Chapter 9.


	The two steps to using Customized Character Sets:

	1)  Use CustomFONT to create a customized fontfile and save it to disk.

	2)  Use the Apple /// System Utilities to install the customized fontfile as
	    the "System Character Set" within the file "SOS.DRIVER" on the
	    appropriate boot disk.

	PDS NAME: CAP'N MAGNETO
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-GAM-03
	BOOTABLE: YES

	Thanks to: Weber Baker for his help.

	NOTE!!!!!

	** Please see the long-lost manual for Cap'n Magneto now on this disk!!! **


	Capt'n Magneto is a formerly-commercial Apple /// game placed into the Public
	Domain by its author, Al Evans.  The program is an interesting one and uses
	fonts extensively throughout.  Pascal-based, this game is full of surprises. It
	is not easy to master, however, and will take some practice.


	Here are some basic instructions - BUT see the manual on this disk side for
	complete details!

	1. To use this PD disk as a stand-alone, copy side B to another disk and
	   place it in .d2.

	2. To use this from Catalyst, simply use the Catalyst interp install routine.
	   To use from Selector or BOS, simply follow the instructions for installing
	   a Pascal-based program.

	3. When playing, the numeric keypad serves as a control pad for various
	   aspects of play.  Thus if you are using DTM (Desktop Manager) or
	   PowerKeys, you will need to see that those keys do not have macros
	   defined. You can use the  first letter of the command, however. The escape
	   key will show you the Command Chart. The period shows the Status Chart.

	4. When you save a game, it gets saved to the current default data directory
	   in the file CM.SAVE.  To clear all saved games delete this file.

	   There are 9 slots to save different games in, with or without passwords.
	   Slot 9 came with a game that had processed quite a ways (CAP'N MAGNTO
	   gains strength and points as he goes if he survives). But it is password
	   protected (and the password has been lost).

	5. At various times some of the characters in the drama (different ones show
	   up on the tricorder reading) spout words of wisdom. (Sometimes they just
	   spout noise and gibberish).  The legible bits of advice are sound, but may
	   not make sense.

	6. To gain points you will have to fight.  As the Command Chart says, the
	   shift key raises your weapon (there are several of increasing potency, and
	   you have to find them) and the arrow keys direct the blow.  Without the
	   shift key the arrows simply move the good CAP'N.  You do not have to fight
	   everyone, however.  Friendly folks (see tricorder if you are not sure;
	   thought unfriendly ones will attack right away) will follow you around and
	   help you fight.  This is a good thing at first since you are weaponless.

	7. There are items called "magic" which do not appear on the screen (at least
	   not on a monochrome).  You have some to start, and if you go to drop
	   something, you will be presented with a list of things to drop.  The last
	   item will be blank.  These are the magic.  Dropping something, by the way,
	   is how you offer items to friends and enemies.  Just drop it in their
	   direction.  The status chart shows you how much of everything you have
	   (except magic).  Some creatures that are angry become friends and go away
	   if given the right item (not all items work and not all creatures get
	   happy).

	8. The world of CAP'N MAGNETO is donut-shaped, so you will always end up
	   where you started.

	The game uses fonts to perform its deeds, and the theory of doing things this
	way was presented in one of the first ON THREE's by the game's author, Al Evans.

	PDS NAME : SUPER TREK 2 BY PAUL CAMPBELL
	DISK ID  : APPLE-3-WAP-GAM-06
	BOOTABLE : YES - SIDE ONE ONLY


	Welcome to the latest update of StarTrek for the Apple ///.

	The first change you will notice is the new character set which
	was created using CustomFont, then modified for this version of
	StarTrek. Aside from all the characters being enhanced, the
	characters used to represent the star ships and bases are new
	to work in harmony with the program code modifications.

	There were a few minor problems with the original Basic program,
	but nothing really serious except for a syntax error which would
	pop up and kill the game when you tried to activate communications
	to the Federation or the Klingons. The fix for this came from Joel
	Crump via the Washington Apple PI TCS. The other difficulty had to
	do with the Galactic Memory Map displayed by the ship's computer.
	This map showed the explored regions of the galaxy, but grew
	distorted with usage to the point where it was really hard to tell
	just were everything was located. This and the other minor problems
	were corrected by simply editing the Basic program code in Apple-
	Writer ///, then executing the WP file from Basic. (Don't try this
	on a MS-DOS system!)

	During play your screen will be split, with the top half being
	for visual display of the Short Range Scanners, the Warp Compass,
	and the Long Range Scanners, and the bottom half being for
	commands and warnings. Speaking of warnings, you should know that
	the starting position of the Enterprise is random, and you may
	find yourself suddenly in the midst of a Klingon occupied sector
	with no visual scanners until AFTER you destroy a ship! (preferably
	not you own...:)

	In playing the game, you will be given a few pointers in the
	instructions at the beginning of the game. You'll probably want
	to play at the lower levels until you get promoted to Admiral!
	At the higher levels, you must have precise control over the warp
	engines and the ability to plot your course accurately to respond
	to attacks on distant Federation Bases.

	If that isn't enough, the Klingon ships grow more numerous with
	stronger shields. They can also effectively dodge your Phasers and
	Photon torpedoes, and tend to attack Starbases more frequently.
	If you select a rank that is beyond your ability, you will be
	reminded of it very quickly by the Federation or the Klingons, but
	not in that order!

	A word about Warping and Photon Torpedoes

	The warp engines can take you one sector at a time or to the other
	side of the galaxy. When activated, you be asked for the direction
	then the warp factor. Entering a warp factor of "1" will place
	your ship in the next quadrant. Entering a ".1" will move you one
	sector within the quadrant. An engine efficiency shift takes place
	at warp ".3". At this warp factor and above, you must consider
	the sector occupied by your ship as one of the traveled sectors.
	For example, if you need to dock with a Starbase and there are
	six markers between the Enterprise and the Starbase, you should
	enter ".7" to dock with the Starbase.

	You really should check with the computer before firing off those
	valuable photon torpedoes, because you cannot reload except by
	docking at a Starbase, and also because you WILL get hit by the
	Klingon ships whether you hit them or not. When you do ask for
	photon trajectories, you will be given a high and a low reading
	for the photon direction. The most accurate trajectory will be
	the exact middle between the two numbers (H-L/2+L=direct hit).
	The phasers lock on target automatically and are very effective
	at close range, but use a lot of energy units. Be sure that you
	know where the the closest Starbase is if you use them frequently.

	You will be given some pointers at the beginning of the game if
	you ask for them. The game can be aborted by holding down
	control-c, or by rebooting if you don't want to complete the
	game in the normal way. Of course, you COULD take the Klingon
	approach to ending the game.... naw, maybe not!

	PDS NAME : SOS DRIVERS
	DISK ID #: APPLE-3-WAP-SYS-07
	BOOTABLE?  Not Bootable


	This disk contains many of the driver files still available for the Apple
	///.  You'll need to use System Utilities (Disk APPLE-3-WAP-SYS-02) and its System
	Configuration Program to create a customized SOS.DRIVER file for your
	computer.

	On Side Two of this disk you'll find some SOS.DRIVER files already set up for
	you.  They are by no means complete and may not match the configuration you
	have.  We have set them up, however, to give you a start at setting up your
	system.  In any case, there are drivers on this disk that will work with many
	of the devices still available (new or used) to hook up to your Apple ///.

	If the SOS.DRIVER files set up on Side Two do NOT match your system
	configuration needs, you can use them as the basis for putting together a
	SOS.DRIVER file that will work.

	If you bought your system used, the odds are excellent that the former user
	has already set up his programs with a SOS.DRIVER that works with that
	system.  In that case, you can use a SOS.DRIVER file from one of the boot
	disks you received and use it as the basis for adding additional drivers when
	you need to (for example, adding a trackball driver, graphics driver,
	hard disk driver, or additional printer driver.)

	For more information on how to set up your SOS.DRIVER file using the System
	Configuration Program (SCP) in System Utilities, please see the file on this
	disk named DRIVER.CONFIG.  If you were lucky enough to get an original set of
	Apple /// manuals, there is information there as well. There is one other
	source, of course: your /// SIG.  We have a number of books in the WAP
	library as well as video and audio tutorial tapes available for take-out.  If
	you are still having trouble, feel free to come to one of our SIG meetings,
	usually held quarterly, at the WAP office.

	Below is a listing of the SOS.DRIVERS on Side Two. If you decide to use one
	of them, you will have to use System Utilities to rename the file (that is,
	take off the number designation at the end).


	SOS.DRIVER1:  .CONSOLE                    (This is the minimum required
	                                           to operate an Apple ///.)

	SOS.DRIVER2:  .CONSOLE
	              .PRINTER (SERIAL PORT:SERIAL PRINTER)

	SOS.DRIVER3:  .CONSOLE
	              .PRINTER (SERIAL CARD IN SLOT 1)
	              .PROFILE (HARD DISK: CONTROLLER CARD IN SLOT 4)

	              .PRINTER (SERIAL PORT: SERIAL PRINTER)
	              .PROFILE (HARD DISK: CONTROLLER CARD IN SLOT 4)

	              .PRINTER (PARALLEL PRINTER: CARD IN SLOT 1)

	              .PROFILE (HARD DISK: CONTROLLER CARD IN SLOT 4)
	              .GRAFIX  (GRAPHICS DRIVER FOR GRAPHICS PROGRAMS)

	As for the drivers on this disk they include the following (NOTE that you
	will have to use the SCP program in System Utilities to designate slots for
	some of these (the driver needs to know where the card is to talk to it.):

	Apple's Original Description:

	ACCESS 3270 is a versatile and user-friendly package that allows
	your Apple /// to access any computer that supports IBM 3270 communications.
	Works exclusively with an Apple 3270 Cluster Controller that rounds out a
	complete,  interactive communications solution  (NOTE: Also works with a
	Modem - Please see the Weber Baker review on this disk). Emulates operation
	on an IBM 3270 keyboard and also gives you reconfiguration options.  Can
	transfer text files to and from a host computer.  Supports comprehensive
	command file capability which provides for auto-dial and auto-log-on
	capabilities.  Provides customized 3270 help screens, ability to filter
	control to and from host, and quick reference keyboard templates. Requires
	phone jack, Apple 3270 Cluster Controller Emulator (or a modem) and an
	applications interface program on the host computer.


	ON SIDE ONE:

	The.Menus     : A file containing the menu files found within Access 3270.
	Read.Me.First : This file.
	Review        : A tutorial/review of Access 3270 by Weber Baker, as
	                published in Frank Moore's Three Magazine of Feburary, 1987.
	                The magazine is no longer published.

	        All the files can be read or printed under Menu.Maker (which is the
	program that Side One boots into.) We've also included a program called
	Print.All which will print ALL ASCII (text) files on this disk easily and
	quickly.


	SIDE TWO

	A bootable copy of Apple Access 3270.  The program is copyable and you can
	place it on your hard disk under BOS3, Selector or Catalyst.The program looks
	and works remarkably like Access ///, the terminal program for the Apple ///
	(little wonder - Apple simply adapted Access /// to make this program...)

	Files include: SOS.KERNEL; SOS.DRIVER; ACS3FONT; AUTOLOG; SOS.INTERP; CONFIG;

	PDS NAME: TerminALL Manual/Program
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-12 & 13
	BOOTABLE?: Bootable (both disks)

	TerminALL is the third program placed into the Public
	Domain by Foxware, Inc. of Salt Lake City, UT.  TerminALL is a
	telecommunications program designed to emulate any number of popular
	terminals, including the DEC VT100 series.

	Disk APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-12 contains the manual for the program and is self-booting.
	Disk APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-13 offers the actual TerminALL Program Disk - in self-booting
	Pascal.


	SOME IMPORTANT NOTES FOR TERMINALL USERS


	       TerminALL  is  an  interesting  telecommunications program, but it has
	one  major problem.  It can not upload or download!  It was primarily
	designed to  allow the Apple /// to emulate any of a series of terminals and
	apparently the   authors  did  NOT  think  uploading  or  downloading  was
	important  or necessary.
	       As  such,  this  program  is  basically  worth  using  by  a  beginner
	interested  in  learning how to use a program that can connect a computer
	with a computer  service  like  CompuServe, Genie or Source or a BBS, like
	the WAP Telecommunications System.  TerminALL can be set for different baud
	rates and protocals,  as  with other telecommunication programs.  We would
	recommend you read  the  manual carefully to familiarize yourself with its
	operation.  If you want  to connect to a BBS or telecom service like
	CompuServe, you can probably use  any  of  the  available terminal modes.
	But the default mode, VT52  is a standard  that  will  serve  you  well if
	all you wish to do is "get your feet wet" in the wonderful world of
	telecomputing.
	        Despite  it's  rather  glaring  negatives, TerminALL is a
	well-written program  that  works with few, if any problems.  It is easy to
	learn and use.  The  WAP  /// SIG again thanks FOXWARE Products for placing
	TerminALL into the public domain for all to use.

	AUGUST, 1989 NOTE:

	        Since this was written, the /// SIG has placed a number of other
	telecom programs and information into the PD library.  Check out disks
	APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-04 or APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-05.  Please also note there are a number of information files
	on both sides of this disk.  Information on other telecom programs, vendors,
	etc.  all are ASCII (Text) files and can be read from Menu.Maker or using the
	program PRINT.ALL on this disk. You can also load these files into any Apple
	/// (or //) word processing program.

	ADDITIONAL NOTE

	The  PASCAL  source code to this program is available from your SIG
	leadership if  you  are  a  programmer  wishing  to  take a look at how
	TerminALL was put together  and/or adapt it to your own needs.  Any
	contributions to the SIG PD library welcome!

	disks that have been "Catalyzed" by the Catalyst hard disk menu program.
	When you place certain copy-protected programs onto a hard disk under
	Catalyst, it "fixes" the original boot disk so it can't be used again.
	This program returns use of that disk to you.

	Side One:

	Catalyst Release for Catalyst 1.0 users.
	REVIEW  : A review of Catalyst Release.

	Side Two:

	Catalyst Release for Catalyst 2.1 users.

	BOOTABLE? SIDE ONE ONLY


	By

	David Ottalini
	WAP /// SIG CO-Chairman


	        A3 REBOOT will let you reboot any program from .D1 with just the
	press of the RETURN key.  The program can do this because its a specially
	prepared version of SELECTOR ///, the hardisk utility program sold by On
	Three.
	        Selector has a "hook" in it, so that when a program ends it doesn't
	take you to the "INSERT DISK AND PRESS CONTROL-RESET" message.  Instead,
	it brings you back to a menu, from which you can then select the next
	application you desire.
	        This version will only allow you to reboot a disk from .D1.  But
	it will give you an idea of what SELECTOR can do.  If you'd like more
	information about Selector and On Three's entire line of programs, you
	can call them at 1-805-822-8580. Their address is 1174 Hickory Ave. in
	Tehachapi, California. Zip is 93561
	        You are currently reading this file from side one of disk APPLE-3-WAP-UTL-38.
	It also includes some additional articles about Selector and a database of
	all articles pertaining to Selector /// (as compiled by the author using
	his THREEWORKS information disks).
	        Side Two contains A3 REBOOT/Selector ///.  Remember to replace our
	SOS.DRIVER file with yours so your system is configured properly.
	As always, your comments and suggestions are most welcome.


	                                                        May 8, 1992

	** May 1995 NOTE:

	If you like Selector /// -  you'll really want to try BOS3 - the new upgrade
	to SOS that includes a built-in program selector among many other features.
	Best of all for Selector users is that BOS3 uses the same pathname structure
	- one that you already know and have used.  For more information, contact
	the WAP office. BOS3 is available from WAP for just $50.00. (all funds go
	into a special Software Development Fund for the ///).

	BOOTABLE? Side One


	        The Epson Screen Printer will work with any Epson or Epson-
	compatable printer (like the Panasonic series) and is designed to let
	the user print text or graphics screens in several different modes.
	        The program was written by Rick Sidwell and originally marketed
	by Alpine Computing, Inc., the precursor to Sun Remarketing.  It has not
	been offered for sale for many years and thus we are happy to place it into
	the Public Domain for anyone interested.


	On Side One you will find:

	MANUAL         : Epson Screen Printer Manual
	READ.ME        : The file you are currently reading
	EPSON.PRINTERS : An AppleWorks/3EZ Pieces DB file containing a bibligraphy

	                 (Taken From ThreeWorks for the Apple /// (c) 1995 David
	                 Ottalini - Shareware)


	On Side Two you will find the Epson Screen Printer Program.  It is
	self-booting under Business Basic and includes a Demo program for you to
	try out on your printer.  Note that we have replaced the orginal SOS.DRIVER
	file with one that will allow you to print from the Apple ///'s RS232
	(Serial) printer.  If you have a parallel printer, there is an Epson driver
	in the SOS.DRIVER file you can make Active using the System Configuration
	Program of System Utilities (or simply replace the SOS.DRIVER file with one
	you know works with your Epson or Epson-compatable printer.

	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-UTL-05
	BOOTABLE? BOTH SIDES


	By David Ottalini
	   WAP /// SIG Co-Chairman


	This is a Business Basic program that will allow you to change the filetypes
	of your Apple /// files.  All the necessary invokables and documentation are
	available on disk for you.  Dr. Jeppson was an early supporter of the /// and
	wrote many of the most interesting programs we have.  He was a mainstay in
	the old Softalk Magazine. I'll bet he's a pretty good dentist too...

	Side One includes a tutorial in Basic you can run using Menu.Maker.  It will
	allow you to print out some of the material.  Side two includes the actual
	program (in Basic) and necessary Invokables.  The programs have been adapted
	to run with Menu.Maker.

	The filetypes available using this program include:

	File Type/#             Description

	$00       0             Typless File
	$01       1             Bad Block File
	$03       2             Pascal Code File
	$03       3             Pascal Text File
	$04       4             ASCII Text File
	$05       5             Pascal Data File
	$06       6             General Binary File
	$07       7             Font File
	$08       8             Graphics Screen File
	$09       9             Business Basic Program File
	$0A       10            Business Basic Data File
	$0B       11            Word Processor File
	$0C       12            SOS System File
	$0D-$0E   13-14         SOS Reserved
	$0F       15            Directory File

	     These are the ones this particular program will not only read - but
	allow you to change.

	     But there are additional types - which now include those taken by Apple
	and various other Apple II developers:

	$15          Screen Library File
	$10          RPS Data File
	$11          RPS Index File
	$12          AppleFile Discard File
	$13          AppleFile Model File
	$14          AppleFile Report Format File
	$16-$18      SOS Reserved
	$19          AW/3EZP Data Base File
	$1A          AW/3EZP Word Processor File
	$1B          AW/3EZP Spreadsheet File
	$1C-$1F      Reserved
	$20          Global File (Desktop Manager)
	$25          Desktop Manager
	$26          Desktop Manager Option
	$27          Note Pad File (Desktop Manager)
	$28          Subload File (Desktop Manager)
	$29-$EE      Reserved
	$AB          GS Basic File
	$AD          GS Basic Data File
	$EF          Pascal Area
	$F0          ProDos Added Comment File
	$F1-$F8      ProDos User Defined Files 1-4
	$F9          ProDos Reserved
	$FA          Integer Basic Program File
	$FB          Integer Basic Variables File
	$FC          Applesoft Program File
	$FD          Applesoft Variable File
	$FE          Relocatable Code File (EDASM)
	$FF          ProDos System File

	        On Three's Communications Manager includes a utility that will allow
	you to change any filetype into any other.
	        Note, however,  that you need to be VERY careful when changing file
	types, since you can really make mash out of a file in moving it from one
	type to another (For example - you can't change a Basic file to ASCII and
	expect Applewriter to read it.) Make a copy and do the conversion on it just
	to be safe.  And as noted above, since the demise of the ///, Apple II
	developers have, on occasion, taken a /// filetype as their own, which could
	cause some problems if you're working with Apple II files.

	SOSTRAN is an Apple ///  utility that can transfer Pascal text files or SOS
	ASCII files to DOS text files. Or  it can move fonts from Apple // Pascal,
	Pilot or DOS tool kit to a SOS font file.   It  will  also  convert Applesoft
	and Integer Basic files to Pascal or Business Basic text files.

	As Frank Moore writes in the enclosed review:

	"SOSTRAN is most powerful for cataloging ][ disks, and in the transfer of
	text, data and font files."

	ON SIDE ONE:

	SOSTRAN.MANUAL   :   An edited but mostly complete transcription of the
	                     SOSTRAN Manual.

	SOSTRAN.REVIEW   :   A short review of the program by Frank Moore of "The
	                     Three Magazine."

	* Note that you can view and print either file with the included Menu.Maker
	  program or by using our "Print.All" program, which will print as many
	  text files from as many disks as you designate.

	ON SIDE TWO:

	The SOSTRAN boot and program (which is Pascal) files.  It can be placed on
	your hard disk and run from BOS3, Selector or Catalyst.
