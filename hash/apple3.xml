	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-FNT-02
	BOOTABLE?: Bootable

	CustomFONT is a wonderful font-creation program that has been
	placed into the PD by Swenson Associates.  It will allow the user to
	create or adapt Apple /// character sets and even has drivers allowing
	the user to print out the custom-created fonts!

	CustomFONT allows you to manipulate and customize the letters, numerals
	and symbols used by your Apple ///.  Character "sets" are stored on disk in
	data files called "fontfiles."  The fontfile used by the Apple /// is called
	"system character set" and is contained in the file named "SOS.DRIVER" on any
	boot (start-up) diskette like AppleWriter ///, Business Basic, Pascal, Draw
	On Three and others. In order to use customized fontfiles in an application,
	you must first use CustomFONT to create the customized fontfile and then use
	the Apple /// System Utilities to modify your application boot diskette,
	specifying that a new fontfile is to be used as the "system character set".
	Fontfile customization is discussed in Chapters 4 though 8, and the Apple ///
	System Utilities are discussed in Chapter 9.


	The two steps to using Customized Character Sets:

	1)  Use CustomFONT to create a customized fontfile and save it to disk.

	2)  Use the Apple /// System Utilities to install the customized fontfile as
	    the "System Character Set" within the file "SOS.DRIVER" on the
	    appropriate boot disk.

	PDS NAME: CAP'N MAGNETO
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-GAM-03
	BOOTABLE: YES

	Thanks to: Weber Baker for his help.

	NOTE!!!!!

	** Please see the long-lost manual for Cap'n Magneto now on this disk!!! **


	Capt'n Magneto is a formerly-commercial Apple /// game placed into the Public
	Domain by its author, Al Evans.  The program is an interesting one and uses
	fonts extensively throughout.  Pascal-based, this game is full of surprises. It
	is not easy to master, however, and will take some practice.


	Here are some basic instructions - BUT see the manual on this disk side for
	complete details!

	1. To use this PD disk as a stand-alone, copy side B to another disk and
	   place it in .d2.

	2. To use this from Catalyst, simply use the Catalyst interp install routine.
	   To use from Selector or BOS, simply follow the instructions for installing
	   a Pascal-based program.

	3. When playing, the numeric keypad serves as a control pad for various
	   aspects of play.  Thus if you are using DTM (Desktop Manager) or
	   PowerKeys, you will need to see that those keys do not have macros
	   defined. You can use the  first letter of the command, however. The escape
	   key will show you the Command Chart. The period shows the Status Chart.

	4. When you save a game, it gets saved to the current default data directory
	   in the file CM.SAVE.  To clear all saved games delete this file.

	   There are 9 slots to save different games in, with or without passwords.
	   Slot 9 came with a game that had processed quite a ways (CAP'N MAGNTO
	   gains strength and points as he goes if he survives). But it is password
	   protected (and the password has been lost).

	5. At various times some of the characters in the drama (different ones show
	   up on the tricorder reading) spout words of wisdom. (Sometimes they just
	   spout noise and gibberish).  The legible bits of advice are sound, but may
	   not make sense.

	6. To gain points you will have to fight.  As the Command Chart says, the
	   shift key raises your weapon (there are several of increasing potency, and
	   you have to find them) and the arrow keys direct the blow.  Without the
	   shift key the arrows simply move the good CAP'N.  You do not have to fight
	   everyone, however.  Friendly folks (see tricorder if you are not sure;
	   thought unfriendly ones will attack right away) will follow you around and
	   help you fight.  This is a good thing at first since you are weaponless.

	7. There are items called "magic" which do not appear on the screen (at least
	   not on a monochrome).  You have some to start, and if you go to drop
	   something, you will be presented with a list of things to drop.  The last
	   item will be blank.  These are the magic.  Dropping something, by the way,
	   is how you offer items to friends and enemies.  Just drop it in their
	   direction.  The status chart shows you how much of everything you have
	   (except magic).  Some creatures that are angry become friends and go away
	   if given the right item (not all items work and not all creatures get
	   happy).

	8. The world of CAP'N MAGNETO is donut-shaped, so you will always end up
	   where you started.

	The game uses fonts to perform its deeds, and the theory of doing things this
	way was presented in one of the first ON THREE's by the game's author, Al Evans.

	PDS NAME : SUPER TREK 2 BY PAUL CAMPBELL
	DISK ID  : APPLE-3-WAP-GAM-06
	BOOTABLE : YES - SIDE ONE ONLY


	Welcome to the latest update of StarTrek for the Apple ///.

	The first change you will notice is the new character set which
	was created using CustomFont, then modified for this version of
	StarTrek. Aside from all the characters being enhanced, the
	characters used to represent the star ships and bases are new
	to work in harmony with the program code modifications.

	There were a few minor problems with the original Basic program,
	but nothing really serious except for a syntax error which would
	pop up and kill the game when you tried to activate communications
	to the Federation or the Klingons. The fix for this came from Joel
	Crump via the Washington Apple PI TCS. The other difficulty had to
	do with the Galactic Memory Map displayed by the ship's computer.
	This map showed the explored regions of the galaxy, but grew
	distorted with usage to the point where it was really hard to tell
	just were everything was located. This and the other minor problems
	were corrected by simply editing the Basic program code in Apple-
	Writer ///, then executing the WP file from Basic. (Don't try this
	on a MS-DOS system!)

	During play your screen will be split, with the top half being
	for visual display of the Short Range Scanners, the Warp Compass,
	and the Long Range Scanners, and the bottom half being for
	commands and warnings. Speaking of warnings, you should know that
	the starting position of the Enterprise is random, and you may
	find yourself suddenly in the midst of a Klingon occupied sector
	with no visual scanners until AFTER you destroy a ship! (preferably
	not you own...:)

	In playing the game, you will be given a few pointers in the
	instructions at the beginning of the game. You'll probably want
	to play at the lower levels until you get promoted to Admiral!
	At the higher levels, you must have precise control over the warp
	engines and the ability to plot your course accurately to respond
	to attacks on distant Federation Bases.

	If that isn't enough, the Klingon ships grow more numerous with
	stronger shields. They can also effectively dodge your Phasers and
	Photon torpedoes, and tend to attack Starbases more frequently.
	If you select a rank that is beyond your ability, you will be
	reminded of it very quickly by the Federation or the Klingons, but
	not in that order!

	A word about Warping and Photon Torpedoes

	The warp engines can take you one sector at a time or to the other
	side of the galaxy. When activated, you be asked for the direction
	then the warp factor. Entering a warp factor of "1" will place
	your ship in the next quadrant. Entering a ".1" will move you one
	sector within the quadrant. An engine efficiency shift takes place
	at warp ".3". At this warp factor and above, you must consider
	the sector occupied by your ship as one of the traveled sectors.
	For example, if you need to dock with a Starbase and there are
	six markers between the Enterprise and the Starbase, you should
	enter ".7" to dock with the Starbase.

	You really should check with the computer before firing off those
	valuable photon torpedoes, because you cannot reload except by
	docking at a Starbase, and also because you WILL get hit by the
	Klingon ships whether you hit them or not. When you do ask for
	photon trajectories, you will be given a high and a low reading
	for the photon direction. The most accurate trajectory will be
	the exact middle between the two numbers (H-L/2+L=direct hit).
	The phasers lock on target automatically and are very effective
	at close range, but use a lot of energy units. Be sure that you
	know where the the closest Starbase is if you use them frequently.

	You will be given some pointers at the beginning of the game if
	you ask for them. The game can be aborted by holding down
	control-c, or by rebooting if you don't want to complete the
	game in the normal way. Of course, you COULD take the Klingon
	approach to ending the game.... naw, maybe not!

	BOOTABLE? Bootable                      


	Chartmaker /// is a PD program from Apple Computer.  It was
	designed to allow users of the Apple Color Plotter to make graphs with
	the Apple ///.  Since most of us don't have plotters, you may wonder
	at its usefullness.  But Wait! You can save the "Charts" you make,
	and then with Draw On, Graphics Manager or Sketchpad load 
	and print them as you would any other graphics file.  Press Open
	Apple and "?" for help on the various commands:  there is no actual
	manual.  This program is excellent for larger "plotted" fonts.

	Features:

	4 Letter Sizes/4 Colors
	7 Proportional Fonts
	Screen Preview
	Up to 10 Text Lines
	Quick/Full Plotting


	SIDE ONE:  Boot

	programs like Draw On ///, Graphics Manager or Sketchpad.  All of
	these graphics were originally developed using the Apple //
	program called Print Shop.  You will generally find SIX graphics
	per foto file.  In some cases, if we could fit them in, there are
	more. 
		This disk continues a lengthy process of converting literally
	thousands of graphics from the Apple // to the Apple ///.  The
	/// SIG wishes to thank John Ruffatto, the /// SIG Librarian
	for allowing us to use his huge collection to get things rolling.
		All the conversions were done using Mel Astrahan's fantastic
	Graphics Manager program.  It rates as one of the best Apple ///
	programs ever produced!

	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-GRX-19
	Bootable? NOT Bootable

	This disk contains a number of Apple /// FOTO files that were originally 
	uploaded to the WAP TCS as GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) files. 

	Here's what you'll find on this disk:

	 SIDE ONE                               SIDE TWO

	 APPLE.LOGO                             BUGS.BUNNY

	 BRICK                                  DRAGON


	NOTES:

	All these graphics files were converted from GIF (Graphics Interchange 
	Format) files ( the GIF format is (c) CompuServe ) using an Apple // program 
	called IIGIF.  It is available on WAP /// SIG disk 3EMM.08, A2.BOOT.  

	Having converted the GIF files (all originally downloaded from the WAP PD 
	Library by John Ruffatto) to 33 block Double HiRes Black and White format 
	binary files, they were either converted from Binary to Foto directly with On
	Three's  Communications Manager or by pulling them into Graphics Manager and 
	then saving them back to disk (Com Manager and Graphics Manager are both 
	available from On Three).

	You can pull any of these 33 block FOTO files into Graphics Manager, Draw On 
	Three, Sketchpad or other Apple /// graphics program and work with them as 
	you would any other graphics file (But you will see a big difference). 
	 However Menu.Maker does not seem to want to display them, nor does the 
	Slideshow Program.  Any solutions to that are welcome.

	These disks are an effort to continue making updated programs and files 
	available to Apple /// enthusiasts.  We hope you enjoy them!

	PDS Name: QUICKIE SCANNED GRAPHICS
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-GRX-24
	Bootable? Not Bootable

	April 28, 1991

	On this disk you will find a number of scanned graphics, obtained by using 
	the Vitesse "Quickie" hand scanner in //e emulation mode.  Many of these 
	graphics have a "college theme" as they were pulled from a catalog featuring 
	various college newspapers.  But you may also enjoy the WAP logo we've 
	included.

	How were these graphics converted to the Apple ///?  It was a fairly
	straightforward process that used an Apple /// with the Titan ///+//e
	cards and a 65c02 CPU chip.  The Quickie runs perfectly under emulation and
	provides Double Hi Res graphics 33 blocks long.  Saved to disk, each binary 
	file was then pulled into the /// in native mode using On Three's Graphics 
	Manager program (it will directly load 33 block Binary Double Hi Res Graphics
	files). Whatever cleaning up that was needed was then done in Graphics
	Manager.  

	Then the file was saved to disk as a 33 block Apple /// FOTO file.

	Here are the graphics on this disk:

	APPLE-3-WAP-GRX-28:  Grafixworks Disk 1
	NOT Bootable


	GrafixWorks is a set of two double-sided disks that include a number of Apple
	/// Fotofiles you can use to help in designing, drawing and producing your own
	graphics.  There are a number of templates, drawing aids and even a few examples
	to help you.  

	TO USE GRAFIXWORKS YOU WILL NEED AN APPLE /// OR ///+ COMPUTER, DRAWING PROGRAM
	AND PRINTER.  YOU MAY ALSO WISH TO HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER GRAPHICS AND FONTS.

	THIS IS A SHAREWARE PRODUCT.  PLEASE FOLLOW DISK INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU CHOOSE TO
	USE THESE DISKS.

	THE FILES

	All of the Fotofiles on these disks were made using On Three's Graphics Manager.
	It allows you to do a tremendous amount of work with graphics and print them out
	easily and quickly.  Used with On Three's Draw On ///, the PD program Sketchpad,
	or any other Apple /// or Apple // graphics program (up to Double HiRes), it is
	a powerful tool you can use for a number of projects.

	Here's what this disk contains:


	Side One            EXPLANATION
	 
	THIN.LINE           Thin Line Border       
	DOUBLE.LINE         Double Line Border
	THICK.LINE          Thick Line Border 
	WICKER              A basic Wicker design
	WICKER2             Variation of Wicker
	WICKER3             Third variation of Wicker
	WICKER.BORDER       Example of a border using Wicker
	WICKER.BORDER2      Second example of a border using Wicker

	Side Two            DESCRIPTION
	 
	BARS.1              Bars - Various widths; Same Lengths
	BARS.2              Bars - Various widths; Same Heights
	BARS.3              Bars - Various widths; 1/2 length of Bars.1
	BOXES.RECS          Boxes and Rectangles
	CUBE                A Cube Design
	CUBE.LH             Example of using Cube Design to start a border/letterhead
	RECTANGLES.1        Rectangles - Thin Line
	RECTANGLES.2        Rectangles - Thick Line


	Many of these designs were inspired by Broderbund's Printshop (tm) program for
	the Apple //.  But the designs work just as well for you in /// mode.  Use them
	for ideas, adapt them to your own use or use them as is.  

	The GrafixWorks PaperTemplates can be used to help you with your graphics
	development.  There's a Blank.Labels file you can load, place it into the Paper
	Template of Graphics Manager and then load graphics and fonts to develop a
	custom label you can capture and copy to each of the six boxes before printing
	them out.

	PDS NAME: DINO Graphics
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-GRX-31
	BOOTABLE? Self-booting

			This disk has lots of fun dinosaur graphics that your children 
	can enjoy in any number of ways.  Here are some suggestions:

	1)  Print out the graphic "Dino.Swamp" in large format and let your kids
		color it with crayons or markers.  Print out the dinosaurs in small
		format. Color them and cut them out. The kids can then move the
		dinosaurs around the swamp for some great dino-play.

	2)  Print out the dinosaurs in large or small format and color them in
		funny patterns.

	3)  After printing, your child can (with your help if necessary
		print the proper name under each dinosaur.
		
	4)  Load a dinosaur into On Three's Graphics Manager or Draw On Three and
		have your child give thoughts about it.  Type those thoughts under the
		dinosaur, print, color and post (or send to grandma!).


	On Side ONE You'll Find These Graphics:

	TYRANA           :Tyrannosaurus
	BRONTA           :Brontasaurus
	STEGA            :Stegosaurus


	On Side TWO You'll Find These Graphics:


	TRI              :Triceratops
	DIMA             :Dimetrodon
	TRI.BABY         :Triceratops Baby
	PTERA            :Pteradactle
	DINO.BOOKMARK    :A Dinosaur Bookmark
	DINO.SWAMP       :A Swamp Just Right for Dinosaurs



	These graphics were all scanned into an Apple //gs computer using the Quickie
	Hand Scanner and ProDos 8 (Apple //e) version software.  We've found that 
	the ProDos 8 software is quicker and easier to use for scanning these graphics
	into memory as a 33 block Double HiRes graphic/Binary File (as opposed to the
	GSOS version of the software).  

	The graphic is saved to a 3.5" disk and then switched to a 512k Apple ///+ 
	equipped with an Apple //e Unidrive.  Loaded into Graphics Manager, the Apple
	// Double HiRes Binary File becomes an Apple /// Fotofile.  It is then
	cleaned up and processed into the final Fotofile that is found on this disk.

	Note that due to the requirements of the SCR.PRT.INV invokable (the assembly
	language module that lets us print these graphics to your printer), the
	graphics on screen appear in INVERSE mode.  Printed, they are in NORMAL mode.

	As set up on this disk, you can print to a SERIAL printer in EPSON emulation
	mode from the RS232/Serial Port on the back of your ///.  Be sure to copy 
	your own SOS.Driver file (set up for your system's printer) to a copy of this
	disk so you can print your graphics properly.)(Remember the default seting is
	".Printer").

	PDS NAME: BOOKPLATE Graphics
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-GRX-32
	BOOTABLE? Self-booting


			The bookplates on this disk began life as a printed graphic that
	was scanned using a Quickie Hand Scanner attached to an Apple //gs.  Saved
	as an Apple // Double HiRes 33 block Binary File, each graphic was then
	loaded into an Apple /// using On Three's Graphics Manager and converted to
	an Apple /// FotoFile.  Graphics Manager was used to clean each bookplate
	up a bit and then saved to disk.  Whew!
			This process does not result in a graphic with high resolution.  If
	there was a driver and software to use the Quickie in the ///, the resolution
	would probably be better (anyone interested?).  But I think you'll agree 
	these are of pretty good quality and fun to print out and use.  
			Print these bookplates "small" and "centered" for best results (left
	is OK too...).  Large mode could be used for a book cover or ??  Use your
	imagination! 
			Note that on Side Two there's a "videoplate" to use with your video
	tapes (VIDEO.TAPEPLATE).  We've also included Slideshow3 so you can look at
	all the graphics in slideshow fashion and Print.Show which will print all
	the graphics for you at one time.  Of course Menu.Maker 6.1 will let you
	look at one graphic at a time and print one out at a time as well.

	BOOTABLE? Self Booting


			3D Graphics is an interesting, tho limited, Business Basic drawing
	program. As noted by our good Canadian friend C.M. Davidson:

	The program "Graph.3D" is one I picked up a couple of years ago at a local 
	swap meet from somebody who had no idea what it is or does, or where it came 
	from.  I think it is a local amateur attempt to design a drawing program 
	using a Joystick.  Not having a joystick, I have never run the program 
	successfully. Perhaps you can do more with it, and eventually put it on a WAP
	PD disk.  Good Luck!

	Martin Davidson
	Burlington, Ont., Canada
	6 April 1992.


	On Side One:

	GRAPH.3D.TEXT:   ASCII text version of the 3D Graphics program.
	TUTORIAL     :   Tutorial on how to use 3D Graphics

	On Side Two  :

	3D Graphics Program along with a couple of FOTOfiles you can load if desired.

	NOTE that this program can not PRINT FOTOfiles in its present form.  But it
	can SAVE them.  We've included our Menu.Maker program on this disk which can
	LOAD and PRINT FOTOfiles as well as Print.Show, a program that will allow you
	to print FOTOfiles from any disk or disks you like.

	PDS NAME: NEW MEMBER DISK
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-inf-01
	BOOTABLE? BOOTABLE - Side One

	SEPTEMBER, 1995 Update


	This New Member Disk (sides one and two) contains a wealth of information
	for new members of Washington Apple Pi's /// SIG. 

	It's specifically a resource for anyone new to Apple /// computers and  
	you should read it carefully and completely.  The Menu.Maker program
	makes it easy to do that.  And it also lets you make a hard copy
	of any text file you wish, simply by answering "Y" or '"y" at the
	appropriate prompt (assuming you have an Epson compatable serial printer
	hooked up to your ///'s serial port ... the 25 pin connector ...in the back
	 of the ///)(We have drivers for other printers.)

	Additionally, if you have Apple Writer, Word Juggler or ///
	EZ Pieces (or for that matter, an Apple // with a ProDos-based word
	processor or Mac with Apple File Exchange and a way to get these files
	onto a 3.5 disk) you can read these text files as well. 

	This disk is but one of a growing /// SIG Public Domain resource designed
	just for you.  On side two, you will find a brief description of 
	our PD disks.  But PD disks APPLE-3-WAP-cat-01-03 contain a complete listing of all that
	our library has to offer, and we recommend them to you!

	Obviously we may have missed something.  If so, come to our next meeting and 
	let's talk about it! 

	We should also mention that there is an Apple /// in the WAP office.  We have
	many software packages, books, software manuals, even a tutorial video tape 
	(VHS) or tutorial cassettes which you may take out and view or listen to.  

	Again, welcome to Washington Apple Pi and the /// SIG! We'll look forward to
	meeting you in person at our next meeting (quarterly on the second Saturday
	at 10:00 AM at the Washington Apple Pi office.

	PDS NAME: Information from The Source
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-INF-04
	BOOTABLE: Side One


	May, 1987
	Updated a tad - March, 1995


	The information on this disk is material originally downloaded by
	various people from The Source, an online information 
	service that no longer exists. As originally placed into the 
	public domain, the information was basically in its raw, unedited form
	and contained a great deal of material that is no longer relavent to the
	Apple /// community.

	The Apple /// SIG of Washington Apple Pi has taken the original material as
	found in the "Information from The Source" public domain disk and edited it
	down considerably to remove extraneous matter.  Much of the information is
	very useful.  However, given the fact that the material comes from 1982, we
	would remind users of this disk that names and addresses are probably
	out-of-date and that some vendors mentioned either no longer exist, no longer
	offer a particular program or have been absorbed into another company
	(VisiCorp is a good example.  It was bought out by Lotus Development and
	Visicalc was subsequently retired).  For an up-to-date listing of vendors,
	please check your /// SIG New Members Disk (III.INF.01).

	We feel there is still a great deal of excellent information contained on the
	disk and hope you will find it useful.

	As always, the /// SIG welcomes your comments and suggestions and welcomes
	any thoughts for future additions to our SIG library.


	One Side One you'll find:

	ACCESS.REVIEW :  A review of Access III V. 1.0
	ACCESS.TECH   :  Technical notes on Access III V. 1.0
	APPLEIII.Q.A. :  Apple /// Q and A on topics that include
					 Apple // emulation, Quark, Super Serial Cards, etc.
	PARALLEL.CARD :  Interactive Structures Parallel Interface for the ///.
	READ.ME.FIRST :  Some initial notes about the information on this disk.
	MESSAGE.CENTER  :Some /// information originally found on The Source.
	PROFILE.DAT.SAV :Review of the Profile Data Saver program for use with
					 PFS.

	On Side Two:

	COPYRIGHT.INFO   :Tutorial on copyrights for computer programs and Databases.
	MARILYN          :Fotofile of that famous actress.
	MORE.A3.Q.A      :Discussions include Pascal, SOSclock, CP/M and more.
	AWRITER.REVIEW   :A not-so-positive review of Applewriter 1.0.
	WJUGGLER.REVIEW  :A review of Word Juggler
	XEBEC.HRD.DISK   :Fairly positive review of a hard drive made by Xebec.

	PDS NAME : OMNIS 3 TECH NOTES
	DISK ID  : APPLE-3-WAP-INF-15
	BOOTABLE ? Side One Only


	Notes as originally complied by:

	D A DataSystems
	3792 Windover Dr.                                 
	Hamburg, NY  14075                                         
	716-648-2462

	(DA Datasystems no longer exists - all its programs were placed into the PD)


	Introducing OMNIS 3 for the Apple ///

	OMNIS 3 has been available for the Apple /// for almost 4 years (we saw an
	advertisement in an old 1981 British Apple magazine); and it has gained a 
	reputation over those years as being one of the most powerful Database 
	Managers available for the machine. 

	Unfortunately it also gained a reputation for carrying with it a somewhat 
	"inaccessible" User Manual. Mostly this was a result of two things. The 
	system was originally developed in Britain and the examples in the manual 
	(and marketing literature) occasionally slip into Pounds and British Postal 
	codes and similar idioms which often add an extra level of potential 
	mis-understanding to the otherwise quite complete examples. Additionally the 
	system was originally developed under the UCSD Pascal System which allowed 
	eventual "ports" of the program to the wide variety of machines appearing on 
	the scene in those halcyon days of the early 80's. (Nowadays you just do an 
	IBM and maybe a Mac version ...sigh). This led to a manual that was scattered
	with notes to the effect that 'Apple ][ users should ignore the next
	paragraph', 'Apple /// users should skip this section...' and similar 
	interruptions of the reading.

	Additionally I also felt, personally, that the TUTORIAL approach taken by the
	documentation was inadequate - I don't like tutorials and rarely have the
	patience to take the time to walk through them; the resulting "dartboard" 
	attempts to use the program can be frustrating.

	Well the program developers, Blythe Software (now with California Offices) 
	recognized this but took a quite realistic look at the Apple /// market of 
	1985 and hesitated. They have recently released a MacIntosh version of OMNIS 
	3 which is drawing RAVE reviews across the board. Their early (premature ?) 
	release of an OMNIS 2 for the Mac in the first mac-month with the original 
	documentation was roundly panned. So for the new Mac version they did a 
	re-write of the entire manual; the result is, we are told, quite well done. 
	They did not feel the potential Apple /// sales volume justified a similar 
	re-write and neither do we.

	But we did still consider OMNIS the most powerful DBMS for the /// - if a bit
	pricey for an "orphan" market.

	Hence the "Revival" on our part of the program in November 1985 and the 50%
	list price reduction (tied, naturally, to some "cross-your-fingers" type 
	volume commitments). We have tentatively agreed to take over technical and 
	customer support for the /// version from Blythe and will be contacting the 
	current users with various support options. In addition we have set about to 
	creating a set of ADDENDA to the User Manual in the form of the enclosed 
	"TECH NOTES". We will be adding to these and definitely request and expect 
	your feedback to this series - such a multi-faceted product can only be 
	adequately supported if it stands upon a wide-ranging usage base. We cannot 
	alone run OMNIS through all its paces and thus need YOUR feedback and 
	comments on YOUR applications to guide us in supporting you and the entire 
	user base.

	RECOMMENDATION

	Well I hate to say it but the TECH NOTES series is not a substitute for a 
	re-write of the manual. You've just GOT to read the ENTIRE manual first; and 
	we cannot see a better, more complete introduction to the program than the 
	TUTORIAL...

	Having done it ourselves the hard way we suggest that the extra time spent 
	plodding through the tutorial/manual now will save hours of thumbing through 
	it later - this really is a tremendously flexible and powerful program which 
	you probably will build a large percentage of your Apple /// usage around. 
	Acknowledging the flaws and occasional omissions of the manual up front we 
	still cannot see how you can fill in the holes without knowing the road. So 
	we recommend the following "startup" process.

	1. Install the system in your floppy or hard-disk based system using the 
	guidelines in the manual. Read the /// notes in the manual. Read our NOTES 
	#1, 9 and 10 if applicable. 

	2. Scan through the entire manual to get a feel primarily for its style and 
	general terminology. You will probably find that the regular linking of 
	descriptions to specifics of the ongoing tutorial/example makes this stage 
	difficult. 

	3. Now scan through our TECH NOTES so you will have a sense of when a 
	particular note should be pulled up in the following steps.

	4. Read through the entirety of the User manual WHILE setting up the sample 
	application described in the manual. Take a few 1-2 hour daily sessions to do
	this.

	5. Now delete those sample files and go ahead and create your own TEST 
	database application. We suggest a simple, single-file Address Book with 
	indexes on Last Name and Zip and simple reports including one label-style and
	one 'boilerplate' letter type. If you maintain name & address data you may
	wish to move that data into this application via a DIF file format if 
	available.

	6. Read through the TECH NOTES again.

	7. Finally sit down and DESIGN your first production application ON PAPER. 
	Draw up lists of fields and field attributes and sketch our some Entry 
	Formats for data entry & retrieval. We strongly recommend a simple "flat 
	file" for now. Unless necessary for the initial application try to avoid 
	multiple connected files; usually you can work with 2 or 3 single 
	applications first then later connect them appropriately. Keep in mind that 
	OMNIS is quite flexible in allowing re-configuring of most anything down the 
	line (you just need some patience for those long - overnight - file reorgs 
	!).  

	8. You WILL get stalled at times; you will find some elements to be pretty 
	obscure as you read & work with them. Give yourself some time climbing this 
	learning curve but then do call us if you feel stymied or need some 
	assistance. Having myself gone through the process of learning to use the 
	beast I know it is regularly frustrating but not too far down the line it 
	starts to get exciting as you begin to realize the breadth and depth of 
	powerful features at your command in the OMNIS program.

	        This disk contains the source code files to Gary Kato's wonderful

	if you were interested enough to purchase this disk.)
	        To see how the program acutally runs, you'll need WAP /// SIG PD disk
	3TEL.05 - XMODEM /// (or you can recomplile the source code).  To help you
	though, we've also included the manual-on-disk as found on 3TEL.05.

	PDS NAME : SOS DRIVERS
	DISK ID #: APPLE-3-WAP-SYS-07
	BOOTABLE?  Not Bootable


	This disk contains many of the driver files still available for the Apple
	///.  You'll need to use System Utilities (Disk APPLE-3-WAP-SYS-02) and its System
	Configuration Program to create a customized SOS.DRIVER file for your
	computer.

	On Side Two of this disk you'll find some SOS.DRIVER files already set up for
	you.  They are by no means complete and may not match the configuration you
	have.  We have set them up, however, to give you a start at setting up your
	system.  In any case, there are drivers on this disk that will work with many
	of the devices still available (new or used) to hook up to your Apple ///.

	If the SOS.DRIVER files set up on Side Two do NOT match your system
	configuration needs, you can use them as the basis for putting together a
	SOS.DRIVER file that will work.

	If you bought your system used, the odds are excellent that the former user
	has already set up his programs with a SOS.DRIVER that works with that
	system.  In that case, you can use a SOS.DRIVER file from one of the boot
	disks you received and use it as the basis for adding additional drivers when
	you need to (for example, adding a trackball driver, graphics driver,
	hard disk driver, or additional printer driver.)

	For more information on how to set up your SOS.DRIVER file using the System
	Configuration Program (SCP) in System Utilities, please see the file on this
	disk named DRIVER.CONFIG.  If you were lucky enough to get an original set of
	Apple /// manuals, there is information there as well. There is one other
	source, of course: your /// SIG.  We have a number of books in the WAP
	library as well as video and audio tutorial tapes available for take-out.  If
	you are still having trouble, feel free to come to one of our SIG meetings,
	usually held quarterly, at the WAP office.

	Below is a listing of the SOS.DRIVERS on Side Two. If you decide to use one
	of them, you will have to use System Utilities to rename the file (that is,
	take off the number designation at the end).


	SOS.DRIVER1:  .CONSOLE                    (This is the minimum required
	                                           to operate an Apple ///.)

	SOS.DRIVER2:  .CONSOLE

	SOS.DRIVER3:  .CONSOLE
	              .PRINTER (SERIAL CARD IN SLOT 1)

	will have to use the SCP program in System Utilities to designate slots for
	some of these (the driver needs to know where the card is to talk to it.):

	INFONET is an information network software program written for novice to
	expert computer users.  INFONET was designed for people who need a method of
	electronic communications between themselves and other computer users.

	INFONET is an easy to use program and has applications for vast numbers of
	organizations.  Examples of effective usage include:

	 -  Retail stores who link with customers and sales people
	 -  Computer user group communication
	 -  School districts communicating with individual schools
	 -  Cottage industry marketing and customer communications
	 -  Any group of computer users for electronic communications


	INFONET was originally sold by Sun Remarketing of Logan, Utah.  In 1987, it
	was placed into the public domain.  It was greatly enhanced
	by Ed Gooding and Walt Pawley and was used for many years (through 1994)
	as the BBS system for the old ///s Company BBS (files donated to WAP).


	SIDE ONE includes Source Code files and the User.Manual file. Our Basic
	version of Menu.Maker is on this disk if you wish to look from another
	Basic disk and read the manual. Print.All is also available to print all
	Text files on this disk (Applewriter or other word processor can also
	be used to read the text files).

	SIDE TWO includes the actual program itself.

	Not Self-Booting.  Users with knowledge of Pascal recommended.

	Apple's Original Description:

	ACCESS 3270 is a versatile and user-friendly package that allows
	your Apple /// to access any computer that supports IBM 3270 communications.
	Works exclusively with an Apple 3270 Cluster Controller that rounds out a
	complete,  interactive communications solution  (NOTE: Also works with a
	Modem - Please see the Weber Baker review on this disk). Emulates operation
	on an IBM 3270 keyboard and also gives you reconfiguration options.  Can
	transfer text files to and from a host computer.  Supports comprehensive
	command file capability which provides for auto-dial and auto-log-on
	capabilities.  Provides customized 3270 help screens, ability to filter
	control to and from host, and quick reference keyboard templates. Requires
	phone jack, Apple 3270 Cluster Controller Emulator (or a modem) and an
	applications interface program on the host computer.


	ON SIDE ONE:

	The.Menus     : A file containing the menu files found within Access 3270.
	Read.Me.First : This file.
	Review        : A tutorial/review of Access 3270 by Weber Baker, as
	                published in Frank Moore's Three Magazine of Feburary, 1987.
	                The magazine is no longer published.

	        All the files can be read or printed under Menu.Maker (which is the
	program that Side One boots into.) We've also included a program called
	Print.All which will print ALL ASCII (text) files on this disk easily and
	quickly.


	SIDE TWO

	A bootable copy of Apple Access 3270.  The program is copyable and you can
	place it on your hard disk under BOS3, Selector or Catalyst.The program looks
	and works remarkably like Access ///, the terminal program for the Apple ///
	(little wonder - Apple simply adapted Access /// to make this program...)

	Files include: SOS.KERNEL; SOS.DRIVER; ACS3FONT; AUTOLOG; SOS.INTERP; CONFIG;
	               TERMREC

	PDS NAME: TerminALL Manual/Program
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-12 & 13
	BOOTABLE?: Bootable (both disks)

	TerminALL is the third program placed into the Public
	Domain by Foxware, Inc. of Salt Lake City, UT.  TerminALL is a
	telecommunications program designed to emulate any number of popular
	terminals, including the DEC VT100 series.

	Disk APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-12 contains the manual for the program and is self-booting.
	Disk APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-13 offers the actual TerminALL Program Disk - in self-booting
	Pascal.


	SOME IMPORTANT NOTES FOR TERMINALL USERS


	       TerminALL  is  an  interesting  telecommunications program, but it has
	one  major problem.  It can not upload or download!  It was primarily
	designed to  allow the Apple /// to emulate any of a series of terminals and
	apparently the   authors  did  NOT  think  uploading  or  downloading  was
	important  or necessary.
	       As  such,  this  program  is  basically  worth  using  by  a  beginner
	interested  in  learning how to use a program that can connect a computer
	with a computer  service  like  CompuServe, Genie or Source or a BBS, like
	the WAP Telecommunications System.  TerminALL can be set for different baud
	rates and protocals,  as  with other telecommunication programs.  We would
	recommend you read  the  manual carefully to familiarize yourself with its
	operation.  If you want  to connect to a BBS or telecom service like
	CompuServe, you can probably use  any  of  the  available terminal modes.
	But the default mode, VT52  is a standard  that  will  serve  you  well if
	all you wish to do is "get your feet wet" in the wonderful world of
	telecomputing.
	        Despite  it's  rather  glaring  negatives, TerminALL is a
	well-written program  that  works with few, if any problems.  It is easy to
	learn and use.  The  WAP  /// SIG again thanks FOXWARE Products for placing
	TerminALL into the public domain for all to use.

	AUGUST, 1989 NOTE:

	        Since this was written, the /// SIG has placed a number of other
	telecom programs and information into the PD library.  Check out disks
	APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-04 or APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-05.  Please also note there are a number of information files
	on both sides of this disk.  Information on other telecom programs, vendors,
	etc.  all are ASCII (Text) files and can be read from Menu.Maker or using the
	program PRINT.ALL on this disk. You can also load these files into any Apple
	/// (or //) word processing program.

	ADDITIONAL NOTE

	The  PASCAL  source code to this program is available from your SIG
	leadership if  you  are  a  programmer  wishing  to  take a look at how
	TerminALL was put together  and/or adapt it to your own needs.  Any
	contributions to the SIG PD library welcome!

	WAP /// SIG CO-Chairman


	        A3 REBOOT will let you reboot any program from .D1 with just the
	press of the RETURN key.  The program can do this because its a specially
	prepared version of SELECTOR ///, the hardisk utility program sold by On
	Three.
	        Selector has a "hook" in it, so that when a program ends it doesn't
	take you to the "INSERT DISK AND PRESS CONTROL-RESET" message.  Instead,
	it brings you back to a menu, from which you can then select the next
	application you desire.
	        This version will only allow you to reboot a disk from .D1.  But
	it will give you an idea of what SELECTOR can do.  If you'd like more
	information about Selector and On Three's entire line of programs, you
	can call them at 1-805-822-8580. Their address is 1174 Hickory Ave. in
	Tehachapi, California. Zip is 93561
	        You are currently reading this file from side one of disk APPLE-3-WAP-UTL-38.
	It also includes some additional articles about Selector and a database of
	all articles pertaining to Selector /// (as compiled by the author using
	his THREEWORKS information disks).
	        Side Two contains A3 REBOOT/Selector ///.  Remember to replace our
	SOS.DRIVER file with yours so your system is configured properly.
	As always, your comments and suggestions are most welcome.


	                                                        May 8, 1992

	** May 1995 NOTE:

	If you like Selector /// -  you'll really want to try BOS3 - the new upgrade
	to SOS that includes a built-in program selector among many other features.
	Best of all for Selector users is that BOS3 uses the same pathname structure
	- one that you already know and have used.  For more information, contact
	the WAP office. BOS3 is available from WAP for just $50.00. (all funds go
	into a special Software Development Fund for the ///).

	BOOTABLE? Side One


	        The Epson Screen Printer will work with any Epson or Epson-
	compatable printer (like the Panasonic series) and is designed to let
	the user print text or graphics screens in several different modes.
	        The program was written by Rick Sidwell and originally marketed
	by Alpine Computing, Inc., the precursor to Sun Remarketing.  It has not
	been offered for sale for many years and thus we are happy to place it into
	the Public Domain for anyone interested.


	On Side One you will find:

	MANUAL         : Epson Screen Printer Manual
	READ.ME        : The file you are currently reading
	EPSON.PRINTERS : An AppleWorks/3EZ Pieces DB file containing a bibligraphy
	                 of articles about Epson printers and the Apple ///.
	                 (Taken From ThreeWorks for the Apple /// (c) 1995 David
	                 Ottalini - Shareware)


	On Side Two you will find the Epson Screen Printer Program.  It is
	self-booting under Business Basic and includes a Demo program for you to
	try out on your printer.  Note that we have replaced the orginal SOS.DRIVER
	file with one that will allow you to print from the Apple ///'s RS232
	(Serial) printer.  If you have a parallel printer, there is an Epson driver
	in the SOS.DRIVER file you can make Active using the System Configuration
	Program of System Utilities (or simply replace the SOS.DRIVER file with one
	you know works with your Epson or Epson-compatable printer.

	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-UTL-05
	BOOTABLE? BOTH SIDES


	By David Ottalini
	   WAP /// SIG Co-Chairman


	This is a Business Basic program that will allow you to change the filetypes
	of your Apple /// files.  All the necessary invokables and documentation are
	available on disk for you.  Dr. Jeppson was an early supporter of the /// and
	wrote many of the most interesting programs we have.  He was a mainstay in
	the old Softalk Magazine. I'll bet he's a pretty good dentist too...

	Side One includes a tutorial in Basic you can run using Menu.Maker.  It will
	allow you to print out some of the material.  Side two includes the actual
	program (in Basic) and necessary Invokables.  The programs have been adapted
	to run with Menu.Maker.

	The filetypes available using this program include:

	File Type/#             Description

	$00       0             Typless File
	$01       1             Bad Block File
	$03       2             Pascal Code File
	$03       3             Pascal Text File
	$04       4             ASCII Text File
	$05       5             Pascal Data File
	$06       6             General Binary File
	$07       7             Font File
	$08       8             Graphics Screen File
	$09       9             Business Basic Program File
	$0A       10            Business Basic Data File
	$0B       11            Word Processor File
	$0C       12            SOS System File
	$0D-$0E   13-14         SOS Reserved
	$0F       15            Directory File

	     These are the ones this particular program will not only read - but
	allow you to change.

	     But there are additional types - which now include those taken by Apple
	and various other Apple II developers:

	$15          Screen Library File
	$10          RPS Data File
	$11          RPS Index File
	$12          AppleFile Discard File
	$13          AppleFile Model File
	$14          AppleFile Report Format File
	$16-$18      SOS Reserved
	$19          AW/3EZP Data Base File
	$1A          AW/3EZP Word Processor File
	$1B          AW/3EZP Spreadsheet File
	$1C-$1F      Reserved
	$20          Global File (Desktop Manager)
	$25          Desktop Manager
	$26          Desktop Manager Option
	$27          Note Pad File (Desktop Manager)
	$28          Subload File (Desktop Manager)
	$29-$EE      Reserved
	$AB          GS Basic File
	$AD          GS Basic Data File
	$EF          Pascal Area
	$F0          ProDos Added Comment File
	$F1-$F8      ProDos User Defined Files 1-4
	$F9          ProDos Reserved
	$FA          Integer Basic Program File
	$FB          Integer Basic Variables File
	$FC          Applesoft Program File
	$FD          Applesoft Variable File
	$FE          Relocatable Code File (EDASM)
	$FF          ProDos System File

	        On Three's Communications Manager includes a utility that will allow
	you to change any filetype into any other.
	        Note, however,  that you need to be VERY careful when changing file
	types, since you can really make mash out of a file in moving it from one
	type to another (For example - you can't change a Basic file to ASCII and
	expect Applewriter to read it.) Make a copy and do the conversion on it just
	to be safe.  And as noted above, since the demise of the ///, Apple II
	developers have, on occasion, taken a /// filetype as their own, which could
	cause some problems if you're working with Apple II files.

	SOSTRAN is an Apple ///  utility that can transfer Pascal text files or SOS
	ASCII files to DOS text files. Or  it can move fonts from Apple // Pascal,
	Pilot or DOS tool kit to a SOS font file.   It  will  also  convert Applesoft
	and Integer Basic files to Pascal or Business Basic text files.

	As Frank Moore writes in the enclosed review:

	"SOSTRAN is most powerful for cataloging ][ disks, and in the transfer of
	text, data and font files."

	ON SIDE ONE:

	SOSTRAN.MANUAL   :   An edited but mostly complete transcription of the
	                     SOSTRAN Manual.

	SOSTRAN.REVIEW   :   A short review of the program by Frank Moore of "The
	                     Three Magazine."

	* Note that you can view and print either file with the included Menu.Maker
	  program or by using our "Print.All" program, which will print as many
	  text files from as many disks as you designate.

	ON SIDE TWO:

	The SOSTRAN boot and program (which is Pascal) files.  It can be placed on
	your hard disk and run from BOS3, Selector or Catalyst.

	Stemwriter may well be the most powerful word processing
	program ever written for the Apple ///. It came from Australia and
	was originally distributed in the US by On Three. The company no
	longer exists and so we've placed the program into the PD for all to
	enjoy.
