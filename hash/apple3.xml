	Easy Accountant is an EZP/ AppleWorks spreadsheet application designed to manage
	the ledger of an individual or a small business running on a cash-basis
	accounting system.  The basic structure of Easy Accountant can be modified or
	expanded to handle your specific needs.

	Easy Accountant will enable you to enter all receipts and expenditures for each
	monthly period and will then compile and print a Monthly Report, a Year-To-Date
	Report and a Detailed Journal Listing Report.

	The Easy Accountant diskette has the following files:

	     ea.dskCMNTATION a wordprocessing file that contains these instructions.

	     ea.WORKSHEET a spreadsheet file consisting of three menu sections, the
	Checkbook Journal, the Adjustments Journal, the Compiler and the Monthly Report.

	     ea.SUMMARY a spreadsheet file used to carry forward the monthly totals and
	to generate the Year-To-Date Report.

	     ea.MACROS a wordprocessing file containing several Autoworks macros for use
	with the worksheet file.

	     ea.NOTES  a wordprocessing file containing additional information, comments
	from users and update notes not found in other files.

	     ea.RECON SCHED a spreadsheet file containing a schedule to assist you in
	getting started with the bank account reconciliation process.

	Unlike double-entry bookkeeping the Easy Accountant books are simple 'single
	entry' journals.  This means that for any transaction, only one entry is made.
	The advantage of a single-entry system is its simplicity. On the other hand, it
	will not provide a complete record of your assets, equipment, inventory, loans
	outstanding or other liabilities.  For most individuals and small businesses a
	single-entry system of accounts will provide the basic information you will need
	to run your business and prepare your tax return.

	APPLE-3-WAP-AZW-02:  3EZ Pieces Checkbook Template by John Lomartire


	      On this disk you'll find a 3EZ Pieces template for keeping your
	   checkbook in good shape.  It was provided by /// SIGer John
	   Lomartire.  A complete tutorial is on side one of this disk in a
	   text file so it can be read or printed with Menu.Maker.  The template
	   and example are on side two.  In addition, we've added a
	   bibliography of all of John Lomartire's articles.  There's also a
	   3EZP/Appleworks data base cross reference of chips on the Apple ///
	   Motherboard as developed by John.


	KEEPING CHECKBOOK RECORDS USING 3 E Z PIECES

	by John Lomartire


	Checkbook systems usually contain a provision for keeping a record of checks
	that have been issued.  Sometimes this takes the form of check stubs on which
	the information is stored, or it might be a separate booklet for retaining
	such data.  In any event, it is generally a chronological entry, most
	probably in check number and date of issuance order.  There is no question
	that this does indeed constitute a record of issued checks but by entering
	the same information into a computer base, a number of advantages are
	attained.


	1.  Computer calculation of balances to verify personal ones.

	2.  Easy location of past checks drawn to specific payees or specific
	    purpose.

	3.  Easy grouping of checks by type of expenditure.

	4.  Quick verification of monthly bank statements.

	5.  Storage of individual expenditures for checks issued for a total payment,
	    e.g. credit card bills.


	Some of the items on the list given above can only be done by laborious
	manual examination of the conventional check record system, but it is an easy
	matter for the computer to handle.

	The approach described here utilizes a spreadsheet but since it depends for
	some of its features on an ability to sort, Visicalc was not applicable.
	Instead, the 3 E Z Pieces spreadsheet was chosen although any other
	spreadsheet program with sorting capabilities would serve as well.  The
	ability to establish different column widths is not imperative in the choice
	of spreadsheet but it is a very convenient feature to have.  Once again, 3 E
	Z Pieces qualifies.

	(It is assumed that the reader knows enough about 3 E Z Pieces to use its
	commands to FIND, ARRANGE, SORT, PRINT etc.  This will not be covered here.)
	SETTING UP THE SPREADSHEET

	The spreadsheet uses columns A through T.  It will be apparent that other
	columns can be added at the user's discretion.  For example, one could
	include a "CODE" column that would identify the type of expenditure, its tax
	status, the issuing department or individual, or some other aspect of data

	organization.  Amplification is simple and will be left to the individual to
	tailor the basic form presented here to his own particular needs.

	Accounting/Finance Templates
	WAP /// SIG AWZ-03

	  Side one is a set of accounting templates provided by /// SIG member Irving
	  Tessel of Los Angeles.  It's simple to use and instructions are provided.
	  On side two we've taken a number of Advanced Visicalc templates and
	  converted them over to 3EZP/AppleWorks spreadsheet format.  Templates
	  included will let you keep track of your expenses, compute your net worth,
	  keep track of your stock portfolio and much more.


	TESSELL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: Side One

	1.  These programs are templates.  When the program is on the screen, change
	the file name.  This will save the template for further use.

	2.  Prepare a Chart of Accounts which shows the account name and the three
	(3) digit account number.

	3.  Before entering either the Cash Receipts or Cash Disbursements, run a
	batch control tape on the dollars. After entering the data, print the report
	labeled CONTROL. Use the record selection "Rec. # begins with...through Rec.
	# begins with or "Check # begins with...through Check # begins with. (See
	example in Test Receipts).  The report total and the adding machine tape must

	agree.  This assure accuracy in entering the correct dollar amounts.

	4. Use the MULTI-RECORD REVIEW/ADD/CHANGE screen to enter the data for both
	programs.  The program is setup to automatically move to the right as data is
	entered.  For example:  After the date is entered, the check # is entered,
	etc.

	5. From the data base program, print to the Clipboard and use the word
	processing program PRINT.CASH.REC. or PRINT.CASH.DIS. to print reports. This
	will allow editing that can't be done in the data base program. Change report
	headings to reflect the report that is being printed.  After printing, delete
	the data portion of the report.  The template can then be reused.

	6. Reports are established to list data by receipt number, check number and
	by General Ledger Account Number with totals for each account.


	CONVERTED ADVANCED VISICALC SPREADSHEETS:  Side Two

	The Templates Include:

	EXPENSE.ACCT
	NET.WORTH
	PORTFOLIO
	JOB.COST.EST
	DEPRECIATION
	PURCHASE.EVAL
	SALARIES
	CONS.SALES.FCST
	INCOME.STMNT
	CASH.FLOW
	MANUFAC.COSTS
	SALES.FORECAST


	All these files were converted from Advanced Visicalc files.  You can load
	them directly into 3EZ Pieces or AppleWorks and they should work for you
	without any trouble.

	MORTGAGE AMORTIZATION

	WAP /// SIG PD DISK 3AWZ.04

	Originally developed by Pacific Technology Systems.

	These templates require any Apple ][ or /// computer, any version of AppleWorks
	and perhaps just a small amount of common sense.

	The templates were built with an instructional approach during development, so
	expect that the templates will not only meet your data management needs, but
	also can be used to teach AppleWorks related activities to yourself as well as
	to others, particularly computer novices.

	MORTGAGE AMORTIZATION is a 3EZ Pieces/AppleWorks Template disk designed to be
	run on any Apple // or /// computer with 128K of RAM.  Please feel free not only
	to use this disk yourself, but also to copy it, give it to friends, add it to a
	club library, and/or ... whatever.  This is a two sided disk, and both sides can
	be copied with any SOS or PRODOS copy program.

	There are three programs included:

	Table A
	   A table for calculating monthly mortgage payments based on loan amount,
	interest rate, and term (in years).
	Analysis B
	   A thirty year analysis of a mortgage, broken into two fifteen year halves to
	operate on an AppleWorks desktop of 55K.
	Analysis C
	   A thirty year analysis of a mortgage as one large AppleWorks spreadsheet.

	Instructions for all three programs are included on the MORTGAGE AMORTIZATION
	disk as 3EZP/AppleWorks word processor files.  We recommend that you print out
	on paper the directions for whichever spreadsheet(s) you plan to use, although
	the instruction files can also be read on-screen.

	Since Analysis B is a spreadsheet that has been broken into two halves we have
	included a step-by-meticulous-step procedure for splicing two spreadsheets as
	part of the instructions.  Even if you are using an extended RAM card, allowing
	you to use the full spreadsheet (Analysis C), we suggest that you try this
	splicing procedure with Analysis B1 and Analysis B2, as it represents a tutorial
	on combining spreadsheets.

	Many features are included within the analysis spreadsheets that are not
	described here (one spreadsheet is worth a thousand words, you know).  We
	suggest that you use, play with, modify, experiment, and add to the
	spreadsheets, always saving your files on your backup disk, leaving the original
	spreadsheets intact.

	Try other move, cut & paste, or rearrange techniques to get the spreadsheets
	to meet your own unique needs.  Personal computers are supposed to be personal,
	aren't they?  If you always follow the procedure of first calculating (Apple-K)
	then rearranging, moving, deleting, etc., you can't go wrong.  Well ... almost!

	Although this MORTGAGE AMORTIZATION disk does not contain a specific refinancing
	spreadsheet, refinancing data can be obtained by using the Analysis spreadsheet
	two times as if calculating on two different properties.  Or, if adventurous,
	you could design your own by using portions of the existing spreadsheets.

	Printer information is stored along with 3EZP/AppleWorks spreadsheets.  Some
	suggestions are given in the instructions for formats appropriate to different
	charts or tables that you might be printing out on your printer.  Do not
	hesitate, however, to change these formats so that they fit your own needs,
	preferences and printer requirements.  Before printing from a spreadsheet, you
	may wish to choose print options (Apple-O) to redesign a form.

	CHECKBOOK MANAGER

	WAP /// SIG PD DISK 3AWZ.05

	Originally developed by Pacific Technology Systems.

	These templates require any Apple // or /// computer, any version of
	AppleWorks and perhaps just a small amount of common sense.

	The templates were built with an instructional approach during development,
	so expect that the templates will not only meet your data management needs,
	but also can be used to teach AppleWorks related activities to yourself as
	well as to others, particularly computer novices

	CHECKBOOK MANAGER is a 3EZP/AppleWorks Template disk designed to be run on
	any Apple // or /// computer with 128K of RAM.  Please feel free not only to
	use this disk yourself, but also to copy it, give it to friends, add it to a
	club library, and/or ... whatever.  This is a double-sided disk, and both
	sides can be copied with any SOS/PRODOS copy program.

	There are four programs included:

	A.00.1986...XXX
	   This is the master spreadsheet that functions as a checkbook ledger.  It
	is used to produce monthly spreadsheets, some of which are included for 1986.
	CHECK CODES
	   A data base with many (too many?) suggested two letter codes for
	categorizing checks.  There is a detailed description of the coding system in
	the instructions file (on disk).
	FOR DEPOSIT ONLY
	   A tiny word processor file to stamp your checks "FOR DEPOSIT ONLY".
	CHECK PRINTER
	   A data base for printing onto checks, particularly "computer-type" checks.

	Directions for all four files are included on the CHECKBOOK MANAGER disk as a
	3EZP/AppleWorks word processor file titled "INSTRUCTIONS". You can print out
	the directions on paper or read them on-screen; take your pick: papyrus or
	cathode ray.

	The data base CHECK CODES uses a category structured for sorting Even if you
	choose not to use these codes, we suggest that you read its instructions and
	look at the data base, as together they form a tutorial on arranging within a
	data base.

	Categories were designed for personal checking use, but the instructions
	indicate a simple method for redesigning the CHECKBOOK MANAGER for small
	business applications.

	The mathematics within the spreadsheets is very simple and straight-forward;
	we have kept it that way to allow ease of modification to the spreadsheets.
	The general system has been set up for you, yet there is still room to alter
	and expand.  Adding columns, perhaps one for tax deductions, should be a snap
	for skilled users of AppleWorks.  Still, we have not forgotten the novice:
	with the included instructions, and because of the attention that we have
	devoted to the format of the spreadsheets, you (yes, even you!) should be
	able to begin using the CHECKBOOK MANAGER immediately.

	BANKCALC #1

	INFORMATION ABOUT THIS DISK :

	     BANKCALC was written by Anthony Powers and published by Micro Book,
	Inc. of Arlington Heights, Illinois in 1982.  It is a collection of 14
	VisiCalc models written by community bankers or Banking Industry
	Software Houses and contributed to the publication.

	    According to the Introduction:

	The purpose of this book is to provide bank personnel with Visicalc
	models which can be used immediately.  As the banker gains experience in
	VC by using these models, he may wish to use them as a base for developing
	his own customized programs.

	     Note that these models can all be pulled into 3EZ Pieces or Appleworks
	and may be of use to the home user in some form or another. We've put them
	into the public domain as part of a continuing attempt to make all formerly
	commercial Apple /// products (that are not still on the market in some form)
	available to the /// community.

	NOTE: WHEN LOADING INTO 3EZ PIECES OR APPLEWORKS, LOAD THE DESIRED MODEL AS
	      A VISICALC FILE RATHER THAN DIF.

	     We've included Menu.Maker on this disk so that (after you've booted into
	Business Basic from another disk or off your hard disk) you can look at these
	files or print them if you like. This information file is available in both
	Text and 3EZP/Appleworks format as well.

	     While these models should hold for the present, please be aware that
	they all came out in the early 1980s and reflect the situation at that time.
	Some of these models may require some changes based on today's realities. As
	this is a PD offering, buyer beware takes precidence here. You should find
	some of these useful.  But there is no implied guarantee that any of these
	models as presented will return information accurate for the 1990s.

	NOTE #2:  THE BOOKS THAT ACCOMPANIED BANKCALC (DISKS 1-2-3) ARE ALL IN THE
	          WAP OFFICE SHOULD YOU NEED TO REFERENCE THEM.


	On Side One of this disk (III.ZAW.07) you'll find the following Visicalc
	models:

	MANAGEMENT MODELS
	-: Model 1:  Variance Analysis of Yields
	             The identification of the causes of month-to-month income
	             variance of assets.

	-: Model 2:  Yield Summary
	             The calculation of monthly yields and costs.

	-: Model 3:  Rate Sensitive Statement of Condition
	             A restatement of the Statement of Condition in terms of rate
	             Sensitivity.


	AMORTIZATION MODELS
	-: Model 4:  Simple Loan Amortization Schedule

	-: Model 5:  Rate of 78 Amortization Model
	             A loan amortization schedule with interest calculated using
	             the rule of 78s.

	-: Model 6:  Effective Rate Model
	             Produces a table of effective interest rates resulting from

	BANKCALC #2

	INFORMATION ABOUT THIS DISK :

	     BANKCALC was written by Anthony Powers and published by Micro Book,
	Inc. of Arlington Heights, Illinois in 1982.  It is a collection of 14
	VisiCalc models written by community bankers or Banking Industry
	Software Houses and contributed to the publication.

	    According to the Introduction:

	The purpose of this book is to provide bank personnel with Visicalc
	models which can be used immediately.  As the banker gains experience in
	VC by using these models, he may wish to use them as a base for developing
	his own customized programs.

	     Note that these models can all be pulled into 3EZ Pieces or Appleworks
	and may be of use to the home user in some form or another. We've put them
	into the public domain as part of a continuing attempt to make all formerly
	commercial Apple /// products (that are not still on the market in some form)
	available to the /// community.

	NOTE: WHEN LOADING INTO 3EZ PIECES OR APPLEWORKS, LOAD THE DESIRED MODEL AS
	      A VISICALC FILE RATHER THAN DIF.

	     We've included Menu.Maker on this disk so that (after you've booted into
	Business Basic from another disk or off your hard disk) you can look at these
	files or print them if you like. This information file is available in both
	Text and 3EZP/Appleworks format as well.

	     While these models should hold for the present, please be aware that
	they all came out in the early 1980s and reflect the situation at that time.
	Some of these models may require some changes based on today's realities. As
	this is a PD offering, buyer beware takes precidence here. You should find
	some of these useful.  But there is no implied guarantee that any of these
	models as presented will return information accurate for the 1990s.

	NOTE #2:  THE BOOKS THAT ACCOMPANIED BANKCALC (DISKS 1-2-3) ARE ALL IN THE
	          WAP OFFICE SHOULD YOU NEED TO REFERENCE THEM.

	DISKS 3AWZ.12-15 : PARISHWORKS
	REQUIRES APPLEWORKS OR 3EZ PIECES
	DISK APPLE-3-WAP-AWZ-12 SIDE ONE IS SELF BOOTING


	These disks have been tried with 3EZ Pieces and all have been shown to load
	and work properly.  If you have an additional church-related templates
	you would like to contribute, we'd love to have them!

	Dave Ottalini
	July, 1993



	                              ParishWorks
	                  INSTRUCTIONS FOR SPECIFIC TEMPLATES


	EXP.CHECK.REG: Expanded Check Register

	The Expanded Check Register includes manual calculation. Every
	time you want the computer to calculate, press <OPEN APPLE> K.
	You can calculate after each check, or you can wait until you
	have entered several or all checks before you calculate. <OPEN APPLE> K
	can be used as often as needed.



	GIVING.DATA and NAMES  (Contributions Database)

	1hese two database files work together for tracking church
	contributions.  Shared with us by Sharon Rivers of Memphis,
	Tennessee.   Here's Sharon's guidelines:


	One file is used for the collection of weekly tithes and the
	other for tither information.  To help keep names and amounts
	separated there are two databases.  The pastor or church
	treasurer should be the only ones that have access to that
	information.  At the end of the year the pastor or treasurer
	could issue a statement telling each person what was their tithe
	for tax purposes.

	On the NAMES database is where the envelope number and name will
	be kept.  This would be for issuance of the envelopes and to
	insure that each family or person in a family has the opportunity
	to tithe.  This also provides the church officials a means to
	track church income to specific areas.  Examples would be the
	Building Fund, Missionary Programs, Colleges, Disaster Relief,
	and other plans based upon the needs and desires of the church.

	Also, the NAMES database could be used for mailing out church
	letters and flyers as a labels template is included along with
	it.

	Randomly distribute your envelopes trying not to match up names
	with numbers.  This can be sorted later by the computer for your
	church reports and really doesn't matter.  Again the only purpose
	it to help keep the church tither's identity a secret from other
	church members.

	Provided are spare fields for future expansion for your specific
	needs.


	To facilitate practice with the GIVING.DATA database, you are
	provided dummy records.  You can sort the information by the date
	or by the number of the person doing the tithe.  Lets do some
	practice reports:

	1.  To find the tithe for just Nov 20th.  Use Open-Apple R to
	    have Appleworks select on the date required then sort on No
	    followed by Date to put the database in correct order.

	File:   Giving.Data
	Page  1
	Report: Weekly
	Selection: Date equals Nov 20 89

	Date      No    Fund 1    Fund 2    Fund 3    Fund 4 Total
	Nov 20 89 1001    0.00     20.00     20.00      0.00 40.00
	Nov 20 89 1002   25.00      0.00      0.00     15.00 40.00
	Nov 20 89 1003    5.00     20.00     20.00      0.00 45.00
	Nov 20 89 1004    0.00     25.00     25.00      0.00 50.00
	Nov 20 89 1005    0.00      0.00      0.00     20.00 20.00
	                 30.00*    65.00*    65.00*    35.00* 195.00*

	You can see all the tithes sorted by the individual number and
	totals down each of the funds.  You can change the names of the
	funds to suit your needs.

	2.  To have a summarized report for any month.  Use Open-Apple R
	    to have Appleworks select on the month required then sort on
	    No to put the database in correct order.

	File:   Giving.Data
	Page  1
	Report: Monthly
	Selection: Date is after Nov  1 89
	  through  Date is before Nov 30 89

	Date      No    Fund 1    Fund 2    Fund 3    Fund 4 Total
	Nov  6 89        30.00     65.00     65.00     35.00 195.00
	Nov 13 89        30.00     65.00     65.00     35.00 195.00
	Nov 20 89        30.00     65.00     65.00     35.00 195.00
	Nov 27 89        30.00     65.00     65.00     35.00 195.00
	                120.00*   260.00*   260.00*   140.00* 780.00*

	Now you have a full picture for the month of November.  At the
	end of the year you can provide to your membership a full list of
	their tithes to help them with their tax information by doing
	this.

	3.  To find the tithe for individuals for the year [or any
	    period] use Open-Apple S to have Appleworks sort on No
	    followed by Date to put the database in correct order. Then
	    use Open-Apple R to select on just a single tither like this:



	File:   Giving.Data
	Page  1
	Report: Individual

	You can now see just how versatile this can be.  You can have it
	automatically give you the yearly reports by using the Auto
	Annual report just by sorting on Date followed by No to put the
	database in correct order.  The report driver will do the
	rest for you.



	PAYROLL.REGISTR: Payroll Register

	1.  Load the template file, and change the filename (for example:
	    MasterPayroll)

	2.  Set up the payroll file for your company:

	    A. Enter the FIXED DATA (the data that will not change from
	       payroll period to payroll period):  for example, the
	       Employee # (in both in Payroll Register and the Cumulative
	       Payroll Report), the Employee Name, the Rate of Pay, and
	       the fixed deductions (the deductions that do not change
	       from period to period; for example, the Other A, Other B,
	       and Other C, if these are fixed).

	    B. Save the file.

	3.  To prepare the Payroll Register for each period:

	    A. Load the most recent payroll file to the screen, and
	       change the filename to reflect the current payroll
	       period (for example, Payroll3.15.90).

	    B. Temporarily MOVE the Cumulative Payroll Report (Rows 58
	       through 110 at the bottom of the file for the long form)
	       to the Clipboard:

	     (1)  Move the cell cursor to the beginning of the
	          Cumulative Payroll Report Row 58.

	     (2)  Enter the MOVE command:  <OPEN APPLE> m for move.

	     (3)  From the options listed at the bottom of the
	          screen, select "To the Clipboard (cut)" by
	          highlighting the option and pressing <RETURN>.

	     (4)  Identify the material to be moved by using the
	          <DOWN ARROW> to highlight through Row 110 (the last
	          line of the Cumulative Report).

	     (5)  <RETURN> to indicate that all of the material to be
	          moved has been identified.

	     (6)  The computer will warn you that "You are about to clear
	          or remove protected cells.  Do you really want to do
	          this?"

	          Select "Yes."

	          (The Cumulative Payroll Report leaves your screen, but
	          it is stored safely on the Clipboard, a temporary
	          storage space provided by AppleWorks.  The Report will
	          remain on the Clipboard until you move it back to the
	          screen later to complete the Cumulative Payroll
	          Report - or until you turn off the computer, whichever
	          comes first.)

	     C. Enter the number of hours worked for ALL EMPLOYEES.

	NOTE:  Unless this is the first payroll period for which the file
	is used, the file currently contains the number of hours from the
	previous period. Change the number of hours worked to the current
	period by moving the cell cursor to the cell, typing the current
	number of hours, and pressing <RETURN>.

	You will note that the computer does not AUTOMATICALLY CALCULATE
	the wages - instead, this file has been set up to calculate only
	when the CALCULATE command is entered in Step D, which follows.

	     D. After all employee work hours have been entered, enter
	        the CALCULATE command - <OPEN APPLE> K for calculate-so
	        that the computer will automatically calculate the
	        Regular Pay, Overtime Pay, and Total Wages for all
	        employees.

	     E. Using the Total Wages amount and a tax table, look up and
	        enter the Federal and State Withholding Taxes (and Other
	        deductions, as needed).

	     F. Enter the CALCULATE command again, and the computer will
	        calculate the Net Pay.

	     G. SAVE the current Payroll Register:  <OPEN APPLE> S.


	4.  To prepare the Cumulative Payroll Report:

	     A. Change the filename to a cumulative report name (for
	        example:  CumPay13.15.90)

	     B. Move the Cumulative Payroll Report from the Clipboard:

	     (1) Move the cell cursor to the beginning of Row 58.

	     (2) Enter the MOVE command.

	     (3) From the options listed at the bottom of the screen,
	         select "From the Clipboard (paste)."

	     (4) From the options listed, select "Formulas and Values."

	         The Cumulative Payroll Report now reappears in Rows 58
	         through 110 of your screen.

	     C.  Enter the CALCULATE command:  <OPEN APPLE> K.

	     The computer automatically adds the current payroll to the
	     previous Cumulative Payroll Report.

	     D.  Save the file:  <OPEN APPLE> S for save.




	PETTY.CASH.REG: Petty Cash Register

	1.  Each payment is recorded in two columns:  the Payments column
	    and one of the Distribution of Payments columns.

	2.  After each line is entered in the register, the "Yes" at the
	    bottom of the screen should have a 1 beside it to signal
	    that the amounts in the two columns were entered alike.

	3.  To print the Petty Cash Register WITHOUT the "test" at the
	    bottom of the file:

	    A. Move the cell cursor to the line following the double
	       line.

	    B. Enter the DELETE command:  <OPEN APPLE> D for delete.

	    C.  Select "Rows."

	    D.  Highlight the rows to be deleted, and <RETURN>.


	MERGING DATABASES by Robert Ericson

	"In many applications you will need to merge information from
	several different sources. This section provides tips for merging
	information from two similar or markedly different database
	files.  Surprisingly few AppleWorks users even know that this can
	be done.

	TIP: When you merge records from two different files,
	their original category orders must match.

	Focus all your attention on the original category orders. From
	the Review mode you can press Apple-N to see the original order.
	Print a copy of the category names screen of the source file,
	then load the destination file. Compare its category names screen
	with the hard copy you just printed.

	Suppose both files have exactly the same original category
	order. To merge the information, follow these steps:

	1. Change the name of the Desktop files, just to be safe.
	   Name the files Source and Destination.

	2. Using multiple-record layout, copy the records in the
	   Source file to the clipboard, then from the clipboard to the
	Destination file.

	3. Check the multiple-record layout in the Destination file to
	make certain that the category information is consistent.

	Note that when the information is transferred, the categories
	appear in the order of the Destination file's single- and
	multiple-record layouts. In the multiple-record layout, the
	category widths are those of the Destination file.

	You can ignore the single- and multiple-record layouts of the
	Source and Destination files until the final check. If they
	match, the original category orders may still differ. If their
	orders differ before-hand, the Destination file will evaluate
	everything in its original category order. Focus all your
	attention on the original category orders.

	TIP: Two Data Base files can be merged even if they have
	different numbers of categories.

	Decide what categories you need to transfer from the Source file
	to the Destination file. For example, the table below compares
	the original category orders of the Everyone list (the Source
	file) and the Members list (the Destination file). The categories
	are identical through the eighth category, PHONE. The remaining
	categories have no value to the Destination file, except for
	NOTE, which has information that belongs in the NOTES category in
	the Destination file.

	|   Table: Everyone list and Members list  |
	|          categories compared 3           |
	|                                          |
	|      Origin File     Destination File    |
	|                                          |
	|      FIRST NAME      LAST NAME           |
	|      LAST NAME       LAST NAME           |
	|      PLACE           PLACE               |
	|      STREET          STREET              |
	|      TOWN            TOWN                |
	|      STATE           STATE               |
	|      ZIP             ZIP                 |
	|      PHONE           PHONE               |
	|      NOTE            COMMITTEE           |
	|      CODE            YEARS               |
	|      KEYWORD         1986                |
	|      Rl              1987                |
	|      R2              1988                |
	|      R3              NOTES               |
	|      R4              RESERVED            |
	|                                          |


	You can proceed with the merge almost as in the last tip. Follow
	these steps:

	1. Change the name of the Desktop files if you have not already
	done so. Name the files Source and Destination.

	2. Delete all Source file categories after PHONE, except for
	   NOTE. Don't worry about report formats, because you will
	   never use this file again.

	3. Insert five categories between PHONE and NOTE. Name
	   them anything, and then return to the multiple-record layout.

	4. Copy the records in the Source file to the clipboard, then
	   from the clipboard to the Destination file.

	5. Check the multiple-record layout in the Destination file to
	   make certain that the category information is consistent.

	Note that all the records from the Source file have gained the
	additional categories of the Destination file. However, the
	Source files have no information in those categories.
	The rules for transferring are easy to remember. If the Source
	file has more categories than the Destination file, the
	additional categories win be lost in the merge. If the Source
	file has fewer categories, it will gain the additional categories
	of the Destination file, but they will contain no information.


	TIP: When the original category orders of two files do not
	match, print the records to an ASCII file.

	Suppose the Source file categories begin with LAST NAME
	and the Destination file categories begin with FIRST NAME.
	This presents a problem. In this case, proceed as follows:

	1. Create a labels-style report format for the Source file in the
	   original category order of the Destination file. Count and
	   make a note of the number of categories in the report.

	2. Select the records you want to print.

	3. Print the report to an ASCII file.

	4. Create a new Data Base file from the ASCII file. Enter the
	   correct number of categories for the new file.

	5. Using multiple-record layout, copy the records in the
	   Source file to the clipboard, then from the clipboard to the
	   Destination file.


	6. Check the multiple-record layout in the Destination file to
	   make certain that the category information is consistent.

	TIP: Merge files to find duplicate entries.

	If you have ever received two copies of a form letter or mis-
	takenly sent two copies to the same person, you will appreciate
	this technique.  It saves postage, paper, and embarrassment.

	Suppose you have two mailing lists on separate files. By merging
	the records, you can find and delete duplicate entries. Create a
	multiple-record layout with FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, STREET, STATE,
	ZIP, and PLACE in that order. Arrange the records alphabetically
	by first name, then by last name. Scan the LAST NAME column for
	duplicate entries. The street address column is the next best
	reference point.

	If the files are too large to merge, merge sections at a time.
	When you find obvious duplication, you may find slightly
	different spellings. One spelling of a name may be more plausible
	than the other, but such corrections are often matters of
	judgment."    (Used With Permission)

	APPLE-3-WAP-ACT-01:  EASy Accouting System

	The EASy Executive Accounting System was first released by the Denver Software
	Company for the Apple /// in 1982.  The company managed to exist through 1986
	before disappearing from the scene.

	The WAP /// SIG has placed this program into the Public Domain as a service
	to our members.

	THE PROGRAMS

	The EASy Executive Accounting System is on the following disks:

	APPLE-3-WAP-act-01a.dsk SIDE ONE: [Catalog] EASy Information
	APPLE-3-WAP-act-01b.dsk SIDE TWO: [Catalog] EASy Startup (self-booting)
	APPLE-3-WAP-act-02a.dsk SIDE ONE: [Catalog] EASy System Disk
	APPLE-3-WAP-act-02b.dsk SIDE TWO: [Catalog] EASy AR (Accounts Receivable)
	APPLE-3-WAP-act-03a.dsk SIDE ONE: [Catalog] EASy AP (Accounts Payable)
	APPLE-3-WAP-act-03b.dsk SIDE TWO: [Catalog] EASy GL (General Ledger)


	OVERVIEW

	EASy is a business software system designed to aid you in the bookkeeping and
	accounting needed to make your business run as efficiently as possible.
	Software means a set of instructions for your computer, and this software
	system is an easy-to-use package tht allows you to record transactions
	without having to know anything about computer programming and with only
	minimal knowledge of accounting.

	In function, EASy is comparable to many far more elaborate systems, and you
	can upgrade the Executive Accounting System (EAS)as the needs of your
	business grow.  No programming skills are necessary to use the EAS since it
	provides you with lists of selections, or menus, from which you choose, and
	instructs you in using the system by means of screen messages.  It even
	provides definitions of certain important accounting terms.  It also allows
	bookkeeping functions and information to be kept for more than one company by
	maintaining separate disks for the accounts payable ledger, the accounts
	receivable ledger, the general ledger, and the SYSTEM disk (this last disk
	also includes information about company name, address and finance policy).

	The EAS makes bookkeeping almost enjoyable.  It should certainly help you
	appreciate the capabilities of your computer.

	* THE EASy EXECUTIVE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM MANUAL IS IN THE WAP LIBRARY.

	PDS NAME: HABAMERGE
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-APL-06
	BOOTABLE? YES



	        Habamerge was a commerical program offered by HABA Systems,
	the original distributor of 3EZ Pieces.  It has the same interface as
	3EZPs and is designed to merge data base mailing list information
	into letters, or as labels. In fact, Habamerge will print THREE ACROSS
	mailing labels -  something 3EZPs can't do! HOWEVER - it will NOT load a 3EZP
	or AppleWorks Word Processing file! ONLY ASCII Text files. (Bummer!) However,
	it is an Assembly Language program (the SOS.INTERP file) so it's pretty fast.

	        We do not have a manual for it, unfortunately. But the program itself
	is self-explanatory and includes demos on disk. You can even print to screen
	to make sure that everything works right.
	        The program is not perfect, one reviewer from another club in fact
	called it "virtually useless" because it can't seem to handle mailing lists
	of different lengths. However, if that isn't a problem for you, see if this
	program isn't worth a little of your time.  IF you have a manual,
	please send us a copy. Or better yet, transcribe it and send a disk!
	        By the way, this program will also work on any Apple //.  This was
	the FIRST commercial product to be shipped so that it could run on either
	machine (the boot code on the // and the /// are in different blocks and
	each machine knows what to look for).  IF you want to run the // version of
	Habamerge, all you have to do is insert this side into your Apple II (any
	version and turn on the machine - or at the Basic Prompt, type:

	]  -Merge.System

	and the program will boot automatically.

	NOTE that AppleWorks 2.0 and above already has mailmerge built in - but I
	don't  believe it can print mailing labels 3 across so it may still prove useful on the // side.

	NOTE2: To use with 3EZPS - you'll have to print your data base mailing list
	to the word processor, then print it to disk (RAM disk is great for this).
	THEN run  HABAmerge and load in the text (ASCII) file after you've set things
	up. Note that the records must be one line each with a Return (NOT a tab) AND
	no space inbetween:

	Joe Apple
	/// Cupertino Lane
	LaLa City, California 66666
	Mary Sparkstation
	ServerCity Road
	Sun City, California 77777
	(etc.)


	SIDE ONE

	Side One

	Informational side - bootable with the Menu.Maker Business Basic Program.
	This disk side includes the Read.Me.First file, and a database of all known
	articles about HABA - both in 3EZP (and Appleworks) format and in ASCII text
	file format (readable by Menu.Maker).

	HABA.DB           3EZPs Database of articles about HABA Systems
	HABA.DB.ASCII     ASCII version of above file
	Read.Me.First     Information file you're reading now.


	Side Two contains Habamerge - it's self booting and easy to use.  Be sure to
	replace our SOS.DRIVER file with your own to use your particular printer. Or,
	if you have a hard disk, simply upload it there and run from BOS, Selector
	or Catalyst.  Again, both the SOS and ProDos versions of the program are
	available ON THIS DISK SIDE.

	BOOTABLE:  YES


	       On  side   one  of  this  disk,  you  will  find information about the
	articles  published  by  Dr. Bloom over the years and where to find them.  We
	have provided them to you in two different forms.  If you have /// EZ Pieces,
	or AppleWorks,  there is a Data Base file which you can pull into the program
	and use  directly.   We have also provided most of the same basic information
	in the  form  of  an ASCII text file which your Menu.Maker program is able to
	read.  Use  the  Text.Dump  program  to  print  it  (or load it into any word
	processing program and print from there.)
	       Also  on side  one,  you will find a listing of disks developed by Dr.
	Bloom and  placed  into  the  public  Domain.   As with the articles, we have
	included both  a /// EZ Pieces Data Base file and an ASCII file with the same
	basic information,  including  where  to  obtain  the disks and how much they
	cost.
	       On side  two of  this  disk you  will find  Dr. Bloom's fine series of
	articles on  "Issues in MicroComputer File and Data  Conversion."  Basically,
	that means  articles discussing  how to get  information from one computer to
	another.  There  are  a  total  of  12 columns included on side two.  To read
	them, simply  highlight  the  "Run.Issues"  selection from Menu.Maker and hit
	.  You  will  be  asked  to turn the disk over and Basic will take it
	from  there. MENU.MAKER will let you print any text file, or you can pull
	them into any Apple family word processor.  We've also included "Print.All"
	that can print all the text files you like.

	        The "Issues" menu looks like this:

	MLM Utilities are a set of very useful utility
	programs for Mail List Manager, the original mail list manager program
	for the Apple ///.  Developed by Dr. Al Bloom.

	MLM Utilities consists of seven modules:

	       1. MLMINFO  consolidates all the important information about an
	          MLM file on a single page - your file's content, structure,
	          sort fields, and print-control specifications.

	       2. MLMSORT  adds  the power of  a general-purpose sort  to your
	          MLM system.   It resequences a file in any order you desire,
	          using any of the up to 14 data fields in an MLM record.

	       3. MLMLIST  is a  flexible and sophisticated list  facility for
	          attractive and meaningful display of MLM data.  This utility
	          allows you to list any MLM file data items in an informative
	          layout of your own choosing.

	       4. MLMCNVT  allows you to respond to changing needs by convert-
	          ing an  MLM file  into another layout.   You may  rename and
	          reorganize  the data  in  an  MLM record,   delete  obsolete
	          fields, combine and split fields, and create new fields.

	       5. MLMERGE  merges the records of a two-disk MLM file.   Dupli-
	          cate records are not merged  into the resulting output file.
	          The result  may be combined  or equally divided  between two
	          output files for easy record insertion.

	       6. MLMASCI  converts  MLM files to  formats that can  be loaded
	          into other systems - AppleWriter, Keystroke, PFS,  /// Easy
	          Pieces, etc.   MLMASCI has four output formats: Apple Writer
	          mail/merge, ASCII text, Name:Value, and DIF.

	       7. MLMUPLD  uploads (creates)  MLM files from other systems and
	          programs.   MLMUPLD accepts four input formats:  ASCII text,
	          Name:Value, DIF, and "comma separated value."

	       The  utilities are  an integrated  system.    The programs  are
	       invoked from,  and  return to,  a master menu for  ease of use.
	       Full use of  "MLM Utilities" requires a 256K Apple  /// with an
	       external disk drive,   and "Mail List Manager"  (Version 1.0 or
	       1.1). A mass storage disk is necessary for MLMERGE.


	This disk is a self-booting Pascal disk and requires APPLE-3-WAP-BLM-09 and 10.
	Completely documented.  See additional information
	on disk APPLE-3-WAP-BLM-10 (side two).

	AWEZP transforms an Apple Writer source file into the format used by the ///
	EZ Pieces (AppleWorks) word processor. The resulting file, once added to the
	EZP desktop, may be printed by EZP/WP without change, or it may be edited
	first to take advantage of EZP/WP's special capabilities or to address the
	few AW/EZP differences that this program does not handle. AWEZP doesn't do
	everything. EZP is a different program from AppleWriter, and some AW commands
	and features can not be translated to EZP/WP, either elegantly or at all.
	AWEZP is intended to give a good basic translation that should be sufficient

	ASCIUPLD converts an ASCII text file (one line per record field) from one
	data base or spread sheet program into the upload format needed by an
	importing program. A special command file tells ASCIUPLD (1) which fields of
	the input ASCII file to be imported and (2) in which order to import the
	fields. It even lets you create import fields that aren't in the original
	file.

	You control the length of the fields in the output upload file. Each may be
	(1) as long as the corresponding input field, (2) no longer than a fixed
	"truncation" length, or (3) truncated or space padded to a fixed length. The
	last handles the "Aladin" data base's quirky restriction that each uploaded
	ASCII file's data field must be exactly as long as the "width" declaration in
	the corresponding Aladin data base record field.

	Disk ID:  APPLE-3-WAP-BLM-14
	BOOTABLE?: YES - Both Sides

	CONPATH tells about ways to convert one file format to another. The premise
	is simple. There are a bunch of "bridges" and a bunch of file formats that
	can be "stepping stones" between the file format you have the the one you
	want. Most commercial data base and spread sheet programs can "import" or
	"export" data in one or more formats. Those files are stepping stones between
	systems. The most common such intermediate files are ASCII, NAME:VALUE, and
	DIF.

	There are also utility programs available specially designed to bridge
	between file formats. The public domain program GRABIT converts an ASCII file
	to QuickFile format. REFORMATTER /// (APPLE-3-WAP-UTL-02) converts a "table file"
	(say a report printed to disk) to DIF or QuickFile format. MLMASCI converts
	Mail List Manager to DIF, ASCII, or NAME:VALUE. NVASCI (APPLE-3-WAP-BLM-16) converts a
	NAME:VALUE file to ASCII format and doesn't ignore null fields.

	There are plenty of "bridges" around. Getting from one file format to another
	can be easy. However, the path from "here" to "there" may not be obvious, it
	may be downright devious, and there may be several paths. CONPATH is designed
	to help you find those pathways.

	NVASCI converts a NAME:VALUE format text file into an ASCII text file with
	one line per record field. Many data base and spread sheet programs can
	"import" an ASCII file - but only if the file contains one line per record
	field. A program like PFS cannot generally produce a "one line per field"
	ASCII file (It ignores blank entries), but it can produce a "one line per
	field" NAME:VALUE file. NVASCI automatically converts that NAME:VALUE file to
	the proper ASCII format for importing. NVASCI is most useful if you have a
	large file to process, or many data names to edit out or many files to
	process.

	PASCAL is a powerful programming language. Its ability to
	have library units that extend the language is an example of that power.
	Apple Computer, Inc. offers one such set of extensions under the name
	"Apple /// Pascal Utility Library," product C3S0001. Those having that
	program product may agree that it is at once a bit more and a bit less
	than is needed for good software engineering in the Apple /// PASCAL
	environment. This disk presents an additional PASCAL utility library,
	one that extends PASCAL even more usefully.

	 SIDE ONE:  Documentation and Source Code Files

	The library unit, PLUTIL, consists of: (On Side Two):

	  1. BASE_TEN     Integer representation of a hex string.
	  2. BLANK1       Strip multiple, leading, and trailing blanks from a
	                  string.
	  3. HEX4         Hexadecimal representation of an integer.
	  4. INC          Increment an integer counter variable.
	  5. INTSTR       Integer representation of a numeric string.
	  6. IOERROR      The name of an input/output error, given its error
	                  code.
	  7. LNAME        Extract a "last name" from a name ordered by first-name,
	                  middle-name or initial, last-name, and suffix.
	  8. NEWLEN       Change the length of a string variable, padding with
	                  blanks if the new length is longer than the old.
	  9. NIBBLEX      Two-character hexadecimal representation of a CHAR field.
	 10. OPEN         Open a file given an English title and default pathname.
	                  Give the user a chance to correct any I/O errors.
	 11. TRANSLIT     Transliterate specified characters in a string.
	 12. UPPERCHR     Change a CHAR variable's alphabetic value to upper case.
	 13. UPPERSTR     Change a string's alphabetic characters to upper case.
	 14. UPPER1       Translate a string variable to mixed case.
	 15. VARIANT      Eight different ways to look at a sixteen-bit word.
	 16. X_TO_Y       Take a long integer X to its Yth (integer) power.

	There is no standard for text files across different operating systems. An
	MS-DOS ASCII text file is subtly different from an Apple /// SOS format ASCII
	text file. Depending on how the file was transferred from the other system,
	those differences might remain in the imported file.

	DIFUTIL was created to deal with those problems. When it encounters an
	SDI/SDF file, it will create the header entries required by the DIF standard.
	It will create an EOD trailer segment if one is missing. It will optionally
	convert E-format numeric entries to decimal format. It is immune to whether
	the original file is in PC/MS-DOS or SOS/ProDOS ASCII text format.

	DIFUTIL allows you to handle many of the minor incompatibilities between
	different implementations of the DIF standard. It does not handle all
	incompatibilities or all problems.

	DISK ID :   APPLE-3-WAP-BLM-24
	BOOTABLE? Self-booting on Side One


	Poster by Bloom is a great Pascal program that will make typewriter-style
	posters in various sizes.  (Disk APPLE-3-WAP-BLM-25: Sign by Bloom is an enhanced
	version of this program.)

	Making big-letter signs is one of the truly fun things that you can do on a
	computer, of any size. Every mainframe system has a "poster" utility program.
	The Apple ][ has any number of poster utilities available to it. Should the
	Apple /// be left out?

	POSTER is a bit of fluff. You can use it for making signs to announce or
	celebrate any occasion. Or simply to express your favorite thought. Your sign
	will be printed in variable-size letters that scroll longitudinally to your
	favorite output device. In any character font that you can address.

	POSTER yields a square-ish set of characters. The 7-by-8 matrix of dots is
	fine for console display, but it's a little sparse when printed. The
	height/width factors let you expand each dot to a rectangle. That's how the
	letters get big. You don't get really professional looking letters.

	POSTER lets you have any horizontal character expansion from 1 to 8. For
	vertical size, the program has a fair idea of wher you are printing your
	sign, and sets limits to the height factor. When printing to the console, for
	example, you may have a height factor of no more than 10 (80 columns divided
	by 8 vertical dots per character). A destination of .PRINTER or .QUME,
	however, yields a maximum height factor of 12 - allowing for letter-size
	paper at 12 cpi.

	POSTER will also center your sign on the paper. A height factor of "1" will
	not yield small text all the way at the bottom of the sign. It will give you
	small text in the middle of the sign.

	Boot and Program are on Side One and Side Two (same program both sides).
	Source code and manual included on disk.

	PDS NAME: SIGN BY BLOOM
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-BLM-25
	BOOTABLE? SELF-BOOTING: SIDE ONE

	Dr. Al Bloom weighs in with another fun PD offering! On this disk
	you will find a text-based sign program.  It's written in Pascal and
	is on Side two of this disk.  Side one has our Menu.Maker program and
	the documentation.  There are TWO character fonts.  The Standard font
	is on Side two. The font for 80 column printers in on Side one.  You
	will find the source code to the program on Side two.

	SIGN prints sideways and its letters fill an 8.5 inch wide page. Each
	SIGN character is composed of many repetitions of its typescript character.
	If SIGN printed with the same character all the time, that position on the
	printwheel would surely go away. If you don't have a daisy-wheel printer, you
	may not be a serious Apple /// owner.

	SIGN comes as an executable code file on the accompanying diskette.

	(NOTE: YOUR /// SIG HAS REPLACED DR. BLOOM'S DRIVER WITH A STANDARD
	    SERIAL DRIVER HOOKED UP TO YOUR ///S SERIAL PORT.  YOU WILL STILL
	    NEED TO CHANGE THIS IF YOU ARE USING A DIFFERENT CONFIGURATION.)

	When you boot the SIGN disk, you will be invited to "Put Pascal system
	disk in built-in drive. Press RETURN." This is a two-step boot process. Just
	remove the boot disk from the built-in drive, flip it over, re-insert it, and
	press RETURN. After a bit more whirring from the drive, you will see the
	program itself.

	SIGN can be installed on the ProFile (under "Catalyst", "Selector" or
	BOS3 for example) as a simple Pascal program. First copy the SYSTEM.STARTUP
	file from the distribution disk to a handy sub-directory and rename it
	SIGN.CODE. Copy the two character set files SIGN.CHARSET and SIGN.CHAR80 into
	the same sub-directory. If you have Pascal 1.1 or Catalyst 2.0 (or later
	versions), SIGN is smart enough to look for the character sets in its own
	directory.

	Whether booted from disk or run from ProFile, SIGN looks the same. It
	presents you with a single screen and will print only one poster at a time.

	BOOTABLE?: Bootable

	DISK /// BACKUP is an automatic backup utility for Apple /// diskettes. The
	program displays side-by-side directories of a master and a backup diskette.
	By comparing file dates, it suggests master files to be backed up. You then
	use keyboard arrows to change those suggestions, for any file on either
	diskette: copy master-to-backup or vice versa, delete backup or master file,
	leave things as they are. The program then executes your wishes. DISK ///
	BACKUP requires a 256K Apple /// and an external diskette drive.

	Until now, backing up files on diskettes hasn't been easy. Unless you copied
	an entire volume. A volume copy may be inappropriate. You may want to keep a
	backup file, delete a file on the master instead of backing it up, or copy
	from the backup. Until now, you had to list each disk directory, compare the
	lists manually, then use the System Filer to do the copies and deletes - one
	at a time. DISK /// BACKUP eliminates that bother. The program handles
	everything - comparing disk catalogs, deciding on what to do with each file,
	and doing it.

	When you boot DISK /// BACKUP, it asks you to insert your master and backup
	volumes, then displays a side-by-side catalog of the disks. The program shows
	you which backup files are current, which master files should be copied to
	backup, and which files on the backup volume either (1) don't exist on the
	master or (2) are more recent than corresponding master files.

	Phase /// was an Apple Computer Conference held during October,
	1987 in Wheaton, Illinois.  Sponsored by The Third Apple Users Group (TAU),
	The Conference included a number of sessions about the Apple ///.  It also
	featured a special survey of the Apple /// Community by Dr. Al Bloom.

	On this disk, you'll find the results of that survey. It provides a unique
	snapshot of what people were thinking about their ///s, and how they were
	using it just a few short years after it was discontinued by Apple.

	The results reflected 55 responses from Apple /// owners in 29 states and
	four foreign countries. The 1,239 programs represented an average of 22.5
	programs per person. The distribution showed that most respondents owned
	between 11 and 20. Two owned five or less, and two real collectors had over
	50.

	The Third Basic
	By Taylor Pohlman


	    Disks APPLE-3-WAP-BSB-03 through 07, contain all 23 articles on Business Basic as
	written by Taylor Pohlman in the old Solftalk Magazine, as well as every
	BUSINESS BASIC program developed for use with those articles.
	    The Menu.Maker program will allow you to read each article and to run
	the programs should you so desire.  BUT PLEASE NOTE:  We would recommend you
	copy the programs to a separate disk and run them from that disk. Since many of
	these programs are basically examples to show certain things that BUSINESS
	BASIC can do, the original program could be damaged.
	    Further, you may need to include other files, like BGRAF.INV or other
	invokable module in order to properly run these programs.  Where space permits,
	we will include these on the disk at the directory level.  But you will have to
	use System Utilities to transfer them to the appropriate disk.
	    Finally:  in order to save space, we have only made APPLE-3-WAP-BSB-01
	a self-booting disk. The rest of the Third Basic disks will include
	Menu.Maker but not the SOS.Kernal, SOS.Driver and SOS.Interp files needed for
	your Apple /// to boot up.  Since Menu.Maker will read and run programs
	from any disk placed in any disk drive, all you have to do is boot this disk (or
	any other Bootable /// SIG PD BUSINESS BASIC disk) and then place the proper
	disk in any disk drive to get your menu.

	    Here's what you'll find on each disk:

	DISK ID :  APPLE-3-WAP-BSB-10
	BOOTABLE?  Side One


	UPDATED APRIL, 1991
	        MAY, 1995

	               FIRST OF ALL: Many thanks to WAP /// SIGer Jim Salerno
	                   for providing the programs for this disk. His efforts are
	                   appreciated!


	               BELOW:  You will find basic information about the
	                   files on side one of this disk:

	               BOOTING...As you have discovered, side one of this disk
	                   is self-booting.  Side two may be accessed by first
	                   running the WAP MENU.MAKER program,
	                   turning the disk over and pressing the <ESCAPE> key.

	                SOS.DRIVER...The "ATTACH" Driver is set to input
	                   ".PRINTER" using APPLE DMP Codes.   Use Control-1
	                   to request screen text printout. Control-2 will
	                   toggle from normal to condensed size print.
	                   Use the KEYPAD NUMBERS for this command. You
	                   will see a letter at the upper right screen position
	                   indicating your selection.   Except for programs
	                   which have redefined the use of the keypad numbers,
	                   this program will permit a screen text printout
	                   whenever a keyboard input is allowed.  It should let
	                   you dump the screen at normal size using just about
	                   any printer.  Try it and see!

	                        ....The serial printer driver,".PRINTER", is
	                   set at 1200 baud,7 bit-odd,with no delays.  This
	                   is to be used with the serial port on the back of
	                   your Apple ///.

	                         ....The parallel printer driver,"PPRINTER"
	                   is for the APPLE UPIC interface card (slot 1).

	                         ....The .Profile driver is a "Universal" driver
	                   for use with a five or ten MB ProFile.

	                         ....We have also included a few other printer
	                   drivers which may better fit your system. But you will
	                   have to set it up accordingly using the System Utilities
	                   "System Configuration Program" (available on WAP PD disk
	                   APPLE-3-WAP-UTL-01).

	                MENU ITEMS...Most items need no explanation, as they
	                    will allow you to catalog a disk or read a file, etc.


	SIDE TWO

	                     PRINTER CONTROL AND LABEL PROGRAMS
	                                DECEMBER, 1987
	                             UPDATED APRIL, 1991

	        Please note that while these programs may not correspond
	directly to your printer, you can adapt them according to your own needs.
	By looking at your printer manual, you can exchange the control codes in
	these programs for those of your printer.  Thus, you'll have a quick
	and easy way to set up your printer or print disk labels from Business Basic.


	        PRINTER.SET
	                A program for selecting printer functions on the Apple

	                over page breaks and numbering each page.
	                REQUIRES PASCAL TO USE.

	        OKIDATA.MENU
	                A menu for the OKIDATA 182 printer is
	                contained in "OKIDATA.MENU".   This may be renamed
	                and used as the printer menu.   If you do this,
	                please save the original printer menu and restore
	                it before leaving.


	                           LABEL PROGRAMS

	        LABELER.1

	                                By CE Software

	                        Transcribed for the WAP /// SIG
	                                by Tim Bouquet


	(NOTE:  The following information comes from a promotional flyer provided by
	CE Software.  It does not substitute for the manual, which is available
	directly from CE Software for $10.00.)


	        Basic has long been a popular language for micro-computers, primarily
	due to its simplicity and ease of learning. However, many programmers feel
	that they eventually must abandon this language for other, more powerful ones
	to overcome some of the limitations of BASIC.  NO MORE!  PPT///, for the
	Apple///, extends the power of the Business Basic interpreter.  Now,
	utilizing Programmer's Power Tools, both beginning and advanced programmers
	have the capability to write sophisticated, advanced programs without
	sacrificing the simplicity of BASIC.


	                                 BENEFITS:

	  o PPT/// will speed up your programs, cutting down such time wasters as
	searching and sorting.

	  o PPT/// will cut your development time by removing the need to write long,
	complicated subroutines for user input and upper/lower case conversion.

	  o PPT/// will give your programs a professional look, allowing you to
	easily incorporate state-of-the-art techniques of user-friendliness.

	  o PPT/// commands meld easily into your BASIC program.


	In March, 1989, CE Software placed PPT /// into the public domain.  You will
	find it on Side B of this disk.  In return for placing the programs into the
	PD, CE Software asks that users purchase the manual for $10.00 which
	includes:

	        o  A complete tutorial manual, with reference section for quick
	           instructions, commented listings of sample programs,
	           demonstration programs and more.

	SIDE ONE:

	        Disk Maker is a Business Basic program for fast copying of /// and //
	Prodos-based disks. It loads the entire disk into memory for multiple copies.
	It will also make disk and address labels.  V1.1
	        Menu Maker will let you boot Disk Maker and when finished, return to
	the Menu.  You'll also find:

	Appleseed.dskcs  : Information about the Appleseeds Basic programs on Side Two

	SIDE TWO:

	     Appleseed, is designed to help you program quickly and
	easily in Business Basic.  Programs on this disk side can be divided into four categories:

	                             1. Seed programs
	                             2. Subroutines
	                             3. Program documentation
	                             4. Utilities

	SEED PROGRAMS:

	Six seed programs are included on this disk - one for each graphics
	mode, one for music, and one for 40-column color text.

	Seed programs are designed to be loaded and listed.  When listed,
	you will see that directions are given in REM statements. The most
	pertinent REM statements will appear at the end of the listing.  This

	way they will stay on the screen for reference while you begin to program.

	Seed programs are time-savers.  When you wish to try simple graphics
	or when you want to add music to your programs, the seed programs are
	ready to use.  All SOS calls have already been written into them.  All
	you have to do is read the REM statements and follow the formula
	described for entering data.  This way you can begin drawing your picture
	or composing your song at once.

	PDS NAME: APPLE /// AND APPLE // GRAPHICS
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-BSB-15
	BOOTABLE? Yes

	By Dave Ottalini


	        This is a disk long in the making.  It developed from my desire to learn a little bit about graphics on the Apple ///, and how to transfer Apple // graphics programs.
	        Frankly, it ain't always easy.  On the Apple // side you have LoRes,
	HiRes and Double HiRes (the GS adds Super HiRes).  On the Apple /// it's four
	different graphics formats, some that approximate the Apple // formats,
	others that don't.
	        Add to that the fact that the programming is somewhat more difficult
	on the /// side (the tradeoff is that /// graphics are more powerful in some
	ways) than on //.  The best example is that to get into Apple // LoRes
	graphics, it's one simple command: GR (for HiRes it's HGR). From there you
	can manipulate the screen as you will, but you are forced to use Peeks and
	Pokes to do it.
	        The Apple /// requires that you OPEN the Graphics Driver, INVOKE the
	BGRAF Invokable module, stipulate the pencolor and fillcolor along with a few
	sundry other things.  But once that's done, you can move on to what you'd
	like to do.  No Peeks or Pokes either.
	        The other problem is the graphics screens.  On the Apple //, the 0,0
	coordinate is at the top left of the screen.  On the ///, it's at the bottom
	left.  That requires some finagling as well.
	        On this disk, you will find a number of attempts at translating from one format to the other. You should find the results interesting.
	        This is a double booting disk that will work on the // or the ///.
	All the programs are on side two.  You can run one particular version, reboot
	and see what the other is like.  Or you can read each program as text files
	should you desire.  Some programs require joysticks to operate properly.

	Side Two:

	lost data is fully and reliably restored.

	If you delete a file and then alter  or  save other files on that
	disk, it is  possible that  parts of the  disk  which  previously
	contained  data  from  your  deleted file  will  be  over-written
	by the  new  data,  and  thus  permanently  lost.   THE RETRIEVER
	may  not  be  able  to recover all or part of a file if it is not
	used  immediately  after  the  file is deleted. Since this cannot
	always  be  the  case, THE RETRIEVER has facilities to assist you
	in recovering partial files under many circumstances.

	Power  Print /// is a Ram Spooler which will allocate a large  section
	of your system's memory as a SERIAL or PARALLEL PRINTER BUFFER.
	The Power Print Buffer is configured as an  installable
	Device  Driver  which  may  replace  your  existing .PRINTER driver. This
	facilitates  printing  of  longer  documents or printouts because the
	printer output is very quickly 'dumped' into the buffer by your
	application  then printed over a much longer period of time, by the
	.PPRINT  driver software.  Your application will resume after
	the dump stage instead of awaiting completion of printing.

	On Side One:

	Power Cat is a disk librarian which will sort and catalog
	over 5000 individual files and programs scattered over up to 500 floppy
	diskettes or on Profile or other hard disk.  The Power Cat report can
	be used to quickly locate current or correct versions of files scattered
	around your not always perfectly organized filing system.

	The  programs  will produce a table of contents of all directories and
	sub-directories which  have been scanned followed by a listing, sorted
	by file name, of all files selected.  Each file will carry a reference
	number  indicating  the  specific  directory  in the table of contents
	which  it  is associated with.  This format allows  more  concise  and
	readable reporting.

	Sorting is accomplished with  a high-speed assembler language quiksort
	routine  which  effectively eliminates  sort  time  as  a  performance
	factor.

	USER.MANUAL:  Complete instructions.

	On Side Two:

	Basic XRF is a utility program that will produce a Sorted
	Cross-Reference of all Variables in any Business Basic program -
	showing all variables used in the program followed by a list of every
	program line that variable is used in.  It is written in a combination
	of Basic and Assembler and uses sophisticated hashing and linked-list
	algorithms for speed and compactness.  Compiled under Basic GTO  to
	increase speed up to 62%.

	BASIC XRF runs  automatically at the prompt,  or may be run using the
	Menu.Maker program by highlighting "RUN.XRF" and pressing return.

	The program will prompt you  for  the  full pathname of the program to
	be cross-referenced, e.g.  .PROFILE/BASIC/TEST/MYPGM (This  file  should not
	be "Locked").  XREF will  then proceed to process  through  your  program
	displaying  the  current  line  number  being  processed and a clock-line
	display to verify that  something is happening.  The program will finally
	prompt you for an output  destination  for  the cross-reference listing.
	This may be a file or listing device such as .PRINTER.

	PDS NAME: Basic Extension
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-DAD-08
	BOOTABLE?: Bootable

	Basic Extension is a series of Basic Invokables placed into the
	Public Domain by Foxware, Inc. of Salt Lake City, UT.  Basic Extension
	can: speed up programs; save disk space; add new functions; decrease
	development time.  Routines include Matrix R/W, Block and Ftype;
	Move and Searrarray; Con, Reboot, Reset, Bit and Upshift.

	Side One: Boot disk and Basic Extension Invokables.

	Invokables on Side One :

	BIT.INV  :   Bit.inv  consists  of two routines:  'Band' and 'Bor'.  Band
	          performs  a  Binary AND of two integer numbers. Bor provides a
	          Binary OR.
	BLOCK.INV:   Block.inv consists of two routines:  Wblock (write block)
	          and Rblock (read block). Their purpose is to allow reading  and
	          writing of 'blocks' of information from disk drives.

	CON.INV  :   One  of  the  two  routines  included  in Con is 'Buff'.  It
	          provides the ability to: 1.  Clear the type ahead buffer of all
	          characters that have not yet been processed. 2. Set the size of
	          the type ahead buffer to any length between 0 & 127
	characters.
	FYTPE.INV:   Ftype  consists  of two routines:  Gftype (get file type) and
	          Cftype (change file type). They allow your program
	          to inspect the type of a file and/or change it.

	MATRW.INV  : Matrw.inv  is a group of procedures which provide high
	          speed disk access, and can reduce  disk  storage  usage  by
	          more  than  30%.    The name 'Matrw.inv' stands for 'Matrix
	          Read Write Invokable'.
	MOVE.INV   : Move  contains  two  routines:  Movenum  (Move numeric) and
	          Movestr  (Move  string). They  both perform similar functions.
	          Move works on numeric arrays while Movestr works  on  string
	          arrays.  Their purpose is to move strings of arrays.
	REBOOT.INV : Reboot zeros all memory, clears the screen, displays "INSERT
	          SYSTEM  DISKETTE & REBOOT"in 40 column black and white, and
	          hangs. Hold down the CONTROL key and press reset to reboot.
	RESET.INV  : Reset.inv is an invokable modual that provides the ability
	          to enable and disable the RESET and CONTROL-RESET
	          functions. If the resets are disabled, pressing RESET or
	          CONTROL and RESET together will have no effect.

	SEARARRAY.INV :Seararray searches a string array for a specified group of
	            characters. It is similar in function to INSTR, but acts on a
	            entire array instead of only one string. Also it can
	            ignore differences between upper and lower case letters
	            during the search.
	UPSHIFT.INV   :Upshift is a routine that  changes  all of the lower
	            letters in a string to upper case. Only letters are affected.
	            Numbers  and  symbols  are  not changed.

	BUGS & PROBLEMS ***

	(1)  Although  we  note  it in the documentation we re-iterate it here that
	the PWR.KEYS  file  (the  main  module)  must remain the FIRST file in the
	/MODULES directory.  Some  folks  regularly  use  the  Public  Domain
	"Directory Sorter" program  on  their  entire  (hard)  disk.  Doing this
	might, for instance, sort Asci.Tbl  first  and  cause  Power  Keys  to hang
	when entered. You may, if you wish,  rename  PWR.KEYS  to  AA.PWRKY  or
	somesuch  which will sort first. The renaming will not affect program
	function.

	(2)  Some  folks appear to be running into problems with QuikScrn in
	particular when  used  in  conjunction  with  the Titan "3+2e" system and its
	.RAM driver. This  appears  to be caused by the large size of the .RAM
	driver.

	(3) The QuikScreen "At-Curs" function is no longer supported.

	PDS NAME : PowerScreen by Tim Harrington
	DISK ID  # APPLE-3-WAP-DAD-11
	BOOTABLE ? Yes - Side One Only (to read manual)


	Module Name Code     : PSCREEN
	Memory Usage         : 3.5K

	REQUIRES POWERKEYS DM+ (3SIG PD DISK APPLE-3-WAP-DAD-09)

	Brief description :

	PowerScreen is a screen dump utility for use with Darryl Anderson's
	Powerkeys utility for the Apple ///.  It allows you to dump either the
	current Power Keys screen (e.g. Keymap, Notepad, Ascii Table) or the user
	program screen (e.g. Help screens in Apple Writer, Driver setup in SCP,
	menu in /// EZ Pieces).

	Functions:

	(1) You can print the entire screen or any rectangle that you define with the
	arrow keys.

	(2) You can abort the dump in case you specified the wrong file name or
	device name.

	(3) You can suppress carriage returns and/or linefeeds.  If you suppress
	carriage returns, PowerScreen will add a space where the carriage return
	would have been.  This is so you can dump a paragraph from one program
	and have your favorite word processor (re)define the margins.

	** NOTE - This was originally a Royaltyware offering by Tim Harrington
	      through TAU - the Third Apple Users Group.


	ALSO ON THIS DISK: Another Powerkeys module called "QSCR.235" - undocumented.

	DISK #  : APPLE-3-WAP-EMM-02
	BOOTABLE: Both Sides

	On side one of this disk you will find information about the
	Apple ///'s emulation mode.  We have included a 3EZ
	Pieces/AppleWorks data base of articles about all aspects of
	emulation mode (including the Titan cards).  This has also
	been turned into an ASCII file, so that you may read it
	using our Menu.Maker program.  We've also included other
	information you might find useful when dealing with Apple //
	Emulation Mode:

	-: Side One
	-: CURSOR.MOD      :Modify your Cursor /// Joystick to work in emulation mode
	-: EM.MODE.ASCII   :Where to find articles on emulation mode (ASCII/Text)
	-: EM.MODE.INFO    :A basic manual/tutorial on emulation mode
	-: EM.MODE.QS      :Commonly asked questions/answers about emulation mode
	-: EMULATION.MODE  :3EZ Pieces/AppleWorks data base of articles on Em Mode
	-: MONITOR.RESET   :Modify your emulation disk to allow reset to monitor
	-: READ.ME.FIRST   :About this disk


	On side two, you will find the "second" 48K emulation disk.
	It is NOT catalogable.  But it IS copyable.  Simply boot it
	first, then place any Apple // DOS 3.3 disk that says it will work
	with 48K of memory, and you're off.  The 48K emulation disk includes
	a menu that allows you to either boot the Apple //
	disk, or change Apple // parameters.  You can boot with
	either Applesoft or Integer Basic as you desire, and make
	other changes.

	Many of the disks in the WAP Apple // library will work in
	emulation mode provided they are DOS 3.3 disks and require a
	maximum of 48K memory.  ProDos disks will not work.  For
	that, you will need to find the Titan ///+//e cards - perhaps from
	another ///er or at a garage sale or vendor (they are no longer made.)

	This is the third Apple /// Emulation disk placed into the Public
	Domain by Washington Apple Pi's /// SIG.  As with disk APPLE-3-WAP-EMM-02, you will
	find some additional information about the Apple ///'s Emulation Mode on
	side one.  Menu.Maker will let you read that information (as you are
	reading this) and print it if you would like.

	On side two, you will find the so-called 2.0 Emulation disk.
	It is NOT catalogable.  But it IS copyable.  This program
	has a date of 9-8-82 on it and was designed to overcome the
	old 48K limit. It uses both upper and lower case. It will,
	under some circumstances, run Apple // software of up to about 64K.
	This program consists of two configuration menus.  The first
	resembles the first Emulation Disk (1043).  The second provides
	several new choices such as "Boot PROMS, Monitor, Font, Reset, etc."
	(See the file Em.Mode.Info for more details.)

	To use, turn this disk over and hit the <CONTROL> and
	<RESET> keys at the same time.  Then place your Apple //
	disk in the internal drive, make your selections, and you're
	off.

	Many of the disks in the WAP Apple // library will work in
	emulation mode provided they are DOS 3.2/3.3 disks and require a
	maximum of 64K memory (remember, though that not all disks
	that say 64K will work...you'll just have to try them.)
	ProDos disks will not work.  For that, you will need the
	Titan ///+//e cards, which are no longer available commercially.

	(For more info on that, see the file Titan.Cards.)

	DISK #    : APPLE-3-WAP-EMM-05
	BOOTABLE  : Side One - With Titan ///+// Cards
	          : Side Two - In Emulation Mode or Apple /// Native Mode

	        This disk continues our efforts at placing Apple /// software
	into the public domain.  Owners of the Titan ///+// card may find this
	disk useful as a backup.  It offers the standard ///+// boot disk but
	includes with it a 64K ProDos Ram Disk on bootup. A native mode RAM
	disk for use with this disk is on disk APPLE-3-WAP-EMM-04.
	        The Titan manual says you can configure the RAM disk by using the
	ProDos utilities disk (found on this side):

	1) Boot ProDos
	2) Run the ProDos Filer (Utilites) by selecting F
	3) Select the VOLUME COMMANDS option
	4) Select FORMAT a volume (F)
	5) Type 5 in the slot number and type in a name of your choice for the RAM
	   disk (A good choice: /RAM)
	6) Type Y in the destroy option
	7) Press ESCAPE twice - returning you to the main menu.
	8) Select FILE COMMAND option (F)
	9) Use Copy Files (C) to move desired Files to the RAM Disk.

	        You can now use the RAM Disk like any other. But when finished,
	remember to save any files in the RAM disk to a floppy or hardisk, as
	you'll lose the RAM disk when shutting down or going back to native mode.


	Side One: Contains the actual Boot Disk for the Titan ///+// Card. It is
	          copyable using Apple /// System Utilities but (since it's DOS 3.3)
	          it is not readable under SOS.

	Side Two: Includes the ProDos 1.01 version of the Apple 2 System Utilities -
	*PRODOS
	*BASIC.SYSTEM
	*FILER
	*STARTUP

	*CONVERT - DOS to ProDos AppleSoft Program
	*MOIRE   - Graphic AppleSoft Program
	*HYPNOSIS- Graphic AppleSoft Program
	*ANIMALS - Fun AppleSoft Program

	        We've also included SOS.INTERP and Menu.Maker on this side if you
	wish to boot from another Apple /// Business Basic Disk or from Selector
	or Catalyst.  Also see:

	Read.Me.First - This file - which contains some basic information about this
	disk.

	        We also commend to you disk APPLE-3-WAP-EMM-04 which contains two data bases of
	information about the Titan cards - a 3EZP/AW Data base of articles published
	about the Titan Cards and a Data Base of material pertaining to the Titan
	cards in the WAP PD library.

	        This disk continues our efforts at placing all Apple /// software

	disk useful as a backup.

	Side One: Information about the Titan cards including: a 3EZP/AW Data base of

	          material pertaining to the Titan cards in the WAP PD library.
	          Also: This READ.ME.FIRST file.


	Side Two: Contains the actual Boot Disk for the Titan ///+//e Card. It is
	          copyable using Apple /// System Utilities but (since it's DOS 3.3)
	          it is not readable under SOS.

	          ALSO:  a RAM DISK Driver you can use with these cards in native
	          mode (requires System Utilites to add to your SOS.DRIVER file.)

	          The manual says that "the SOS RAM Disk functions just like any
	          other disk driver: Files can be saved and retrieved and certain
	          applications will use if for mass storage (like a communications
	          program.) Files can be transfered just as if you were using any
	          other disk drive."

	          But you are also reminded to save any important files on a
	          regular floppy drive before rebooting or turning the power off!

	This version of the Titan ///+//e Emulation Disk has been updated a tad by

	Block 01.  The Block 00 code was then replaced with the ProDos Double Boot
	code - so that it will now boot either SOS or ProDos from this disk - you
	can place a program ON the emulation disk - either SOS or ProDos - and
	run it without having to switchout disks.  Further - you can now LIST this
	disk.  While you WON'T see the Titan file - you can see other files. Those
	included on this disk include:


	|File Name       Blocks  Modified   Time  File Type
	|
	| A3PLUS2E.DRVRS      1  9-Apr-93  14:21  Directory

	PDS NAME: A2 BOOT
	DISK #  : APPLE-3-WAP-EMM-08
	BOOTABLE: WITH TITAN ///+//e Cards


	WELCOME!

	A2 BOOT is designed for Apple /// users of Titan's ///+//e Cards (although it
	can be used by anyone with an Apple //c or e or GS as well with a 5.25"
	drive).

	Basically, A2 BOOT tries to be a one-stop disk that provides many of the more
	useful utility programs found in the WAP Apple // Public Domain (some
	programs are shareware).


	TO USE THIS DISK (FOR APPLE /// USERS)

	You will have to boot the Titan ///+//e Boot Disk, replace that disk with A2
	BOOT and then choose the "Apple //e" option from the Titan menu.  You will
	find yourself being asked to run a menu program called "WINDOWS", run a
	program selector program called "Byrd's Better Bye" or simply quitting to
	Basic.

	WINDOWS is much like our own Menu.Maker program in that it will allow you
	to read and print text files, look at graphics files or run Basic files.  It
	can do more, though.  It will run any "SYSTEM" file (much like a SOS.INTERP
	file) and it will also read AppleWorks text files (and print them).

	Byrd's Better Bye gives you a selection of SYSTEM files you can run or
	"launch" depending on what you'd like to do.

	By the way, you can turn over this disk and press the <CONTROL> key and
	"M"
	key at the same time to get a catalog and run any program or read any file.
	Side Two also has the Windows menu program on it (but NOT ProDos).

	Some of these programs may require an "Enhanced Apple //e" to
	work.  That means you will need to have a 65c02 chip installed in your
	motherboard (It replaces the original 6502A or B CPU (Central Processing
	Unit) chip).  You can get one for less than $10.00 from:

	                  Jameco Electronics
	                  1355 Shoreway Road
	                  Belmont, CA. 94002
	                  (415)-592-8097 (Order Hotline)

	Send $2.00 for a catalog.  They will be free after your first order.   Be
	aware that Jameco requires a minimum order (seems to depend on ordering from
	ad or catalog).  Need help to install this chip?  Bring your /// to a SIG
	meeting (we meet quarterly).  We'll be happy to do it for you!


	APPLE // USERS

	As with any other Apple // disk, simply place Side One of A2 BOOT into your
	5.25" boot drive and boot the disk.


	WHAT'S ON THIS DISK


	Enough with the explanations!  Here's what is on Side One:

	 BASIC             : AppleSoft Basic (ProDos version)
	 BLU               : A popular file compression program
	 BLU.dskC           : Documentation for BLU

	 PD.TERMS          : WAP's Lee Raesly explains the differences in PD
	                     software
	 PRODOS            : Version 1.8 of ProDos Operating System (Apple //
	                     equivalent of SOS.Kernel)
	 WINDOWS           : The program  you are using  now. It is  a text  file
	                     reader and Program Selector (If you select an entry
	                     - by  highlighting it - and depress return - it will
	                     show it to you on the screen  (where you can also print
	                     it to your printer with the command shown to  the
	                     right of the previous screen (CNTRL P - That is depress
	                     the key marked control, and holding it down depress the
	                     P). Go back to the  previous screen by depressing the
	                     key marked esc and check out the commands you can use or
	                     run it if it is a program.

	                     WINDOWS uses DOGPAW (a ProDOS extension (that is, it
	                     adds  itself to ProDOS to give extra commands that can
	                     be used by various  programs - such as WINDOWS!))

	                     (Also found on Side Two)


	And on Side Two:

	 FASTCOPY          : A fastcopy disk utility
	 GRAFE             : GRAFE is an Applesoft BASIC program that allows the
	                     editing of random-access text (TXT) files under ProDOS.
	 GRAFE.dskC         : Documentation for Grafe
	 IIGIF.dskCS        : Documentation for GIF
	 UNSHRINK          : Free version of Shrinkit that will UNshrink many
	                     files compressed using Shrinkit or other similar
	                     Apple // archive program.
	 UNSHRINK.README   : Documentation for Shrinkit

	 SPLITTER          : ProDos Text File Splitter program:  Run from Basic
	 TEX.dskC           : Documentation for Tex
	 TEX2.01           : TEXt File Helper:  Use it to read, append, delete
	                     text files and more.


	The TEXt File Helper program will (among other things) allow you to "Type"
	(read) any of the DOC files on this disk from your screen.  The Startup
	(Printer) program will print them for you if you desire (or use AppleWriter
	or other word processing program (including FREEWRITER)).

	Note also that some of these programs use MouseText graphics, which are not
	available from the Titan ///+//e emulation mode.  Don't worry about it.  The
	screen may look a bit weird, but text is readable and programs run fine.

	Also be aware that if you have a ProFile card installed in your ///, and it
	has been modified to run under ///+//e emulation, this disk will not boot. In
	fact, you will only be able to run (up to) ProDos version 1.1.1.  You will
	have to take the Profile card out or place a 1.1.1 version of Prodos on a
	copy of this disk (ah the little things you learn through long hours of
	frustration!).

	PDS NAME: DOUBLE BOOT
	DISK #  : APPLE-3-WAP-EMM-09
	BOOTABLE: YES


	        I went about constructing this disk fairly objectively.
	I had read that putting together a "double-booting disk" should be easy:

	        The book "Beneath Apple ProDos" (by Don Worth and Pieter Lechner)
	says this:

	"Block 1 on a ProDos volume contains the SOS boot loader. This program is
	loaded instead of Block 0 when booted on an Apple ///.  It searchs the
	directory for SOS.KERNEL and loads it instead of ProDOS. This means that a
	diskette can be constructed which will boot either ProDOS or SOS and run an
	application on either an Apple // or Apple ///."

	        And the book Inside Apple's ProDOS (by John Campbell) says:

	"... In Chapter nine it was mentioned that blocks 0 and 1 on a ProDOS
	diskette store the boot code.  This code reads the operating system software
	and executes that code.  What was not mentioned was that this boot code will
	run on either the Apple // computers or on an Apple ///.

	As you power up either an Apple // or Apple /// computer system, with a
	ProDOS diskette installed, the boot code read into memory and executed is
	loaded at 2048=$800.  The first item of business for this boot code is to
	determine whether the software is running on an Apple // or an Apple ///
	computer system.  Once this code makes that determination, then either:

	-PRODOS, for the Apple // family
	-SOS.KERNEL for the Apple /// computer

	will be loaded.  If the correct file is not found for the computer being
	used, an error message is displayed.

	The implication of this is that a single application may be written and
	placed on a single diskette that could be run on either computer.  This
	single diskette could then be sold to owners of either Apple // computers or
	Apple /// computers."


	        So I decided to try it.  After formating a disk, I copied ProDOS and
	Basic.System, then the three SOS files.  It didn't work.  It would boot on
	one machine but not the other.  I tried copying the SOS files first, but that
	didn't work either.
	        Then I remembered that Frank Moore of Pair Software had issued
	GoForth, a Forth language program, as a double-boot disk.  I decided to take
	the lazy way out and copied the boot disk, replaced Forth.System with
	Basic.System and replaced SOS.Interp for the Basic Sos.Interp.  It worked.
	        A block editor did indeed show that the SOS boot code was in Block 1.
	I'm not quite sure why I could not do it by just formatting and copying but
	the end result is that we DO have a properly set-up double-boot disk that you
	might enjoy trying out.
	        On Side One is this file and all the others that go into making a
	/// SIG boot disk.  On the ProDOS side, you'll find the 1.1.1 version for
	///ers who have Titan ///+//e cards.  If you have a //e or GS, you can
	replace it with a later version.  A WAP ProDOS menu program is also included.
	        On Side Two you'll find just the three SOS boot files and the two
	ProDOS boot files.  Copy the volume and then replace the Interp or
	System files as needed.  But in the end, you'll have a disk that can be
	used on either machine.  Obviously there will be some space limitations due to
	the overhead of all the files.  But we think you'll find this disk interesting
	and useful!

	PDS NAME:  MODIFIED 48K/64K APPLE ][ EMULATION BY DALE WARNKE
	DISK ID :  DISK APPLE-3-WAP-EMM-10
	BOOTABLE?  Yes - Side One
	           Yes - Side Two with Titan ///+// Card


	Side One of this Apple ][ Emulation disk mades some changes to the old 48K
	emulation disk (just insert into .D1 and turn on your ///). Side Two makes many
	of the same changes (see additional note below) but can only be used with the
	Titan ///+// card.

	1. EMULATION MENUS: The Apple ][ menus indentify the enhancements on this Apple
	][ Emulation.

	2. LOWER CASE CHARACTERS: The standard disk does not provide lower case
	characters and this version doesn't either; However, a version of the 48K
	Emulation having lower case is available.

	3. SERIAL CARD: The original 48K Emulation disk is hardcoded for 300 baud, 7
	bit, mark parity) and can be changed via the menu on the disk version. However,
	if put on the hard disk via Catalyst, the emulation menu routine does not update
	the code and the hardcode (300 baud) is always in effect. Catalyst 2.1
	implements a menu routine which actually writes to the emulated ROM code but
	into the wrong places; Do NOT use the Catalyst 2.1 installed Emulation.

	   This disk has its hardcode set to 1200 baud (still 7 bit, mark parity).

	4. ESC+ cursor: In Business BASIC, the ESC cursor, screen edit mode is indicated
	by the flashing + character.  With this patch, the Applesoft BASIC, Integer
	BASIC and Monitor ESC cursor, screen edit mode is indicated by a flashing
	Open-Apple character for DOS 3.3 (ProDOS intercepts this enhancement).

	   (See the old Apple ][ Reference manual (bottom of Page 35) for the use of the
	ESC cursor, editing moves using the \IJKM\ keys; Standard for the Apple ][, the
	IJKM, under the ESC mode, work like the Apple /// cursor keys. This very handy
	for running Apple ][ programs directly from the catalog listing).

	   (This patch is has the target locations, FECE.FEDA in place of the old WRITE
	tape code, FD11.FD14, FD2F.FD31, FBA2.FBA4, and FD39.  See CALL  A.P.P.L.E March
	1983, p. 51).

	5. RESET

	   This modification allows the booting of another Apple ][ application disk
	without rebooting the Emulation Disk. To quit one apple ][ program disk, for
	example, one game to start another:

	   Press the  RESET  key

	   Insert the new application disk into the built-in drive and type (without the
	spaces):

	   6  CTL-P  RETURN

	   and the new disk will boot.

	   This same procedure will allow recovery from a lockup of an Apple ][ program
	most of the time.

	   (The RESET and NMI vectors are modified to point to the old Apple ][ monitor
	routine. This modification is at target locations FFFA.FFFD.  See Softalk, July
	1983, p. 219).

	6. The Apple ][ + does not have UP and DOWN cursor keys.  Thus the Apple ][
	Emulation Disk for the Apple /// only worked with the LEFT and RIGHT cursor keys
	or with the JKLM cursor keys in ESCAPE Mode.

	   This disk has been modified so the UP/DOWN cursor keys work in the ESCAPE
	mode. The JKLM cursor keys do NOT work in ESCAPE mode on this disk.

	   The code changed to enable the UP and DOWN cursor keys is at the Apple ][
	target locations:

	   a) The table, XLTBL at FB11.FB18
	   b) The Code at FBA5.FBB2
	   c) FBB3:EA  is and should not be changed; This location is used by some
	programs to identify the 48K Apple ][+ .
	   d) The Code at FBB4.FBB7


	   Programs which make calls to the middle of the above code ranges may not
	function properly and may even lock up the System; However, such programs are
	expected to be the exception, not the rule.


	On Side Two: 64K Emulation Modifications.

	All the modifications mentioned above for the 48K emulation disk have also been
	made on the 64K emulation disk (for use with the Titan ///+//e card. Dale notes,
	however, that ProDos intercepts his "up/down" cursor patches. There are some
	other, undocumented, patches.  This 64K version is still DOS by the way -
	copyable with System Utilities, but NOT readable.

	PDS NAME:  HOT ROD III UTILITIES - COMPILED BY DALE WARNKE
	DISK ID :  DISK APPLE-3-WAP-EMM-11
	BOOTABLE?  Yes - In Apple II Emulation Mode


	"Hot Rod ///" was a series of articles written by George Oetzel in the old
	Shoptalk Magazine from July through September, 1983.  Full texts are
	available from the WAP Office. But basically, the articles concerned
	themselves with the Apple /// emulation mode - and how to soup it up.
	As Oetzel himself wrote: "With a little imagination, you can make the
	Apple /// emulate some versions of the Apple II that the company never
	built. That's where the excitement begins."

	This disk includes the Hot Rod /// utilities and programs described
	by George Oetzel in his articles. There are also some programs from Call
	A.P.P.L.E.  Many, many thanks to Dale Warnke, PhD for making this disk
	available to us. You can contact him directly at (714)-786-8249.

	Both sides are copyable using System Utilities in native mode, or
	Copy II Plus or other Apple II utility.

	REMEMBER to set your language to "Integer" at the Emulation Menu before
	running side one of this disk (Both sides are DOS 3.3)

	THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT FOR THE NOVICE!!! BUT - IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN
	LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE APPLE II EMULATION MODE ON THE /// - THIS IS

	CustomFONT is a wonderful font-creation program that has been
	placed into the PD by Swenson Associates.  It will allow the user to
	create or adapt Apple /// character sets and even has drivers allowing
	the user to print out the custom-created fonts!

	CustomFONT allows you to manipulate and customize the letters, numerals
	and symbols used by your Apple ///.  Character "sets" are stored on disk in
	data files called "fontfiles."  The fontfile used by the Apple /// is called
	"system character set" and is contained in the file named "SOS.DRIVER" on any
	boot (start-up) diskette like AppleWriter ///, Business Basic, Pascal, Draw
	On Three and others. In order to use customized fontfiles in an application,
	you must first use CustomFONT to create the customized fontfile and then use
	the Apple /// System Utilities to modify your application boot diskette,
	specifying that a new fontfile is to be used as the "system character set".
	Fontfile customization is discussed in Chapters 4 though 8, and the Apple ///
	System Utilities are discussed in Chapter 9.


	The two steps to using Customized Character Sets:

	1)  Use CustomFONT to create a customized fontfile and save it to disk.

	2)  Use the Apple /// System Utilities to install the customized fontfile as
	    the "System Character Set" within the file "SOS.DRIVER" on the
	    appropriate boot disk.

	PDS NAME: CAP'N MAGNETO

	BOOTABLE: YES

	Thanks to: Weber Baker for his help.

	NOTE!!!!!

	** Please see the long-lost manual for Cap'n Magneto now on this disk!!! **


	Capt'n Magneto is a formerly-commercial Apple /// game placed into the Public
	Domain by its author, Al Evans.  The program is an interesting one and uses
	fonts extensively throughout.  Pascal-based, this game is full of surprises. It
	is not easy to master, however, and will take some practice.


	Here are some basic instructions - BUT see the manual on this disk side for
	complete details!

	1. To use this PD disk as a stand-alone, copy side B to another disk and
	   place it in .d2.

	2. To use this from Catalyst, simply use the Catalyst interp install routine.
	   To use from Selector or BOS, simply follow the instructions for installing
	   a Pascal-based program.

	3. When playing, the numeric keypad serves as a control pad for various
	   aspects of play.  Thus if you are using DTM (Desktop Manager) or
	   PowerKeys, you will need to see that those keys do not have macros
	   defined. You can use the  first letter of the command, however. The escape
	   key will show you the Command Chart. The period shows the Status Chart.

	4. When you save a game, it gets saved to the current default data directory
	   in the file CM.SAVE.  To clear all saved games delete this file.

	   There are 9 slots to save different games in, with or without passwords.
	   Slot 9 came with a game that had processed quite a ways (CAP'N MAGNTO
	   gains strength and points as he goes if he survives). But it is password
	   protected (and the password has been lost).

	5. At various times some of the characters in the drama (different ones show
	   up on the tricorder reading) spout words of wisdom. (Sometimes they just
	   spout noise and gibberish).  The legible bits of advice are sound, but may
	   not make sense.

	6. To gain points you will have to fight.  As the Command Chart says, the
	   shift key raises your weapon (there are several of increasing potency, and
	   you have to find them) and the arrow keys direct the blow.  Without the
	   shift key the arrows simply move the good CAP'N.  You do not have to fight
	   everyone, however.  Friendly folks (see tricorder if you are not sure;
	   thought unfriendly ones will attack right away) will follow you around and
	   help you fight.  This is a good thing at first since you are weaponless.

	7. There are items called "magic" which do not appear on the screen (at least
	   not on a monochrome).  You have some to start, and if you go to drop
	   something, you will be presented with a list of things to drop.  The last
	   item will be blank.  These are the magic.  Dropping something, by the way,
	   is how you offer items to friends and enemies.  Just drop it in their
	   direction.  The status chart shows you how much of everything you have
	   (except magic).  Some creatures that are angry become friends and go away
	   if given the right item (not all items work and not all creatures get
	   happy).

	8. The world of CAP'N MAGNETO is donut-shaped, so you will always end up
	   where you started.

	The game uses fonts to perform its deeds, and the theory of doing things this
	way was presented in one of the first ON THREE's by the game's author, Al Evans.

	PDS NAME : SUPER TREK 2 BY PAUL CAMPBELL
	DISK ID  : APPLE-3-WAP-GAM-06
	BOOTABLE : YES - SIDE ONE ONLY


	Welcome to the latest update of StarTrek for the Apple ///.

	The first change you will notice is the new character set which
	was created using CustomFont, then modified for this version of
	StarTrek. Aside from all the characters being enhanced, the
	characters used to represent the star ships and bases are new
	to work in harmony with the program code modifications.

	There were a few minor problems with the original Basic program,
	but nothing really serious except for a syntax error which would
	pop up and kill the game when you tried to activate communications
	to the Federation or the Klingons. The fix for this came from Joel
	Crump via the Washington Apple PI TCS. The other difficulty had to
	do with the Galactic Memory Map displayed by the ship's computer.
	This map showed the explored regions of the galaxy, but grew
	distorted with usage to the point where it was really hard to tell
	just were everything was located. This and the other minor problems
	were corrected by simply editing the Basic program code in Apple-
	Writer ///, then executing the WP file from Basic. (Don't try this
	on a MS-DOS system!)

	During play your screen will be split, with the top half being
	for visual display of the Short Range Scanners, the Warp Compass,
	and the Long Range Scanners, and the bottom half being for
	commands and warnings. Speaking of warnings, you should know that
	the starting position of the Enterprise is random, and you may
	find yourself suddenly in the midst of a Klingon occupied sector
	with no visual scanners until AFTER you destroy a ship! (preferably
	not you own...:)

	In playing the game, you will be given a few pointers in the
	instructions at the beginning of the game. You'll probably want
	to play at the lower levels until you get promoted to Admiral!
	At the higher levels, you must have precise control over the warp
	engines and the ability to plot your course accurately to respond
	to attacks on distant Federation Bases.

	If that isn't enough, the Klingon ships grow more numerous with
	stronger shields. They can also effectively dodge your Phasers and
	Photon torpedoes, and tend to attack Starbases more frequently.
	If you select a rank that is beyond your ability, you will be
	reminded of it very quickly by the Federation or the Klingons, but
	not in that order!

	A word about Warping and Photon Torpedoes

	The warp engines can take you one sector at a time or to the other
	side of the galaxy. When activated, you be asked for the direction
	then the warp factor. Entering a warp factor of "1" will place
	your ship in the next quadrant. Entering a ".1" will move you one
	sector within the quadrant. An engine efficiency shift takes place
	at warp ".3". At this warp factor and above, you must consider
	the sector occupied by your ship as one of the traveled sectors.
	For example, if you need to dock with a Starbase and there are
	six markers between the Enterprise and the Starbase, you should
	enter ".7" to dock with the Starbase.

	You really should check with the computer before firing off those
	valuable photon torpedoes, because you cannot reload except by
	docking at a Starbase, and also because you WILL get hit by the
	Klingon ships whether you hit them or not. When you do ask for
	photon trajectories, you will be given a high and a low reading
	for the photon direction. The most accurate trajectory will be
	the exact middle between the two numbers (H-L/2+L=direct hit).
	The phasers lock on target automatically and are very effective
	at close range, but use a lot of energy units. Be sure that you
	know where the the closest Starbase is if you use them frequently.

	You will be given some pointers at the beginning of the game if
	you ask for them. The game can be aborted by holding down
	control-c, or by rebooting if you don't want to complete the
	game in the normal way. Of course, you COULD take the Klingon
	approach to ending the game.... naw, maybe not!

	Chartmaker /// is a PD program from Apple Computer.  It was
	designed to allow users of the Apple Color Plotter to make graphs with
	the Apple ///.  Since most of us don't have plotters, you may wonder
	at its usefullness.  But Wait! You can save the "Charts" you make,
	and then with Draw On, Graphics Manager or Sketchpad load
	and print them as you would any other graphics file.  Press Open
	Apple and "?" for help on the various commands:  there is no actual
	manual.  This program is excellent for larger "plotted" fonts.

	Features:

	4 Letter Sizes/4 Colors
	7 Proportional Fonts
	Screen Preview
	Up to 10 Text Lines
	Quick/Full Plotting

	Disk ID#: APPLE-3-WAP-grx-17
	Bootable? Not Bootable

	    This is our sixth graphics disk for use with Apple /// graphics
	programs like Draw On ///, Graphics Manager or Sketchpad.  All of
	these graphics were originally developed using the Apple //
	program called Print Shop.  You will generally find SIX graphics
	per foto file.  In some cases, if we could fit them in, there are
	more.
	    This disk continues a lengthy process of converting literally
	thousands of graphics from the Apple // to the Apple ///.  The
	/// SIG wishes to thank John Ruffatto, the /// SIG Librarian
	for allowing us to use his huge collection to get things rolling.
	    All the conversions were done using Mel Astrahan's fantastic
	Graphics Manager program.  It rates as one of the best Apple ///
	programs ever produced!

	PLOTING AND GRAPHING WITH THE ///

	PDS NAME: Graphics Utilities
	DISK ID#: APPLE-3-WAP-grx-18
	BOOTABLE?: Bootable

	A series of utility programs in Basic by Dr. Carlo Infante. Mostly designed for
	use with a plotter, these programs can be looked at for ideas on how to program
	using graphics.


	On Side One:

	-: BUS.GRAPH    : Business Basic program that produces a bar graph.
	-: FREQ.PLOTS   : Business Basic program that produces frequency plots.
	-: GRAPH.PAP.PL : Business Basic program that prints graph paper on a
	-:                plotter.
	-: PLOT.UTIL    : Business Basic plot utility program.
	-: WEIGHT.CHART : Business Basic weight chart program for a plotter.
	-: CRT.IK.VD.PL : Business Basic program to measure CRT current.
	-: GRATICULE    : Business Basic program to generate standard scope
	-:                graticule.
	-: RES.4.GRAPH.S2 : Business Basic program that graphs four of the
	-:                  resolution definitions.
	-: INSTRUCTIONS   : How to use this disk.


	Side Two Contains:

	-: DCM.TEXT : This program reads a data file of binary or text in format
	-:            and enables plotting of the data.
	-: DCMA.TEXT: This is a graphics dump utility.  Excellent discussion about
	-:            Apple /// graphics.

	Bootable? NOT Bootable

	This disk contains a number of Apple /// FOTO files that were originally
	uploaded to the WAP TCS as GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) files.

	Here's what you'll find on this disk:

	 SIDE ONE                               SIDE TWO

	 APPLE.LOGO                             BUGS.BUNNY

	NOTES:

	All these graphics files were converted from GIF (Graphics Interchange
	Format) files ( the GIF format is (c) CompuServe ) using an Apple // program
	called IIGIF.  It is available on WAP /// SIG disk 3EMM.08, A2.BOOT.

	Having converted the GIF files (all originally downloaded from the WAP PD
	Library by John Ruffatto) to 33 block Double HiRes Black and White format
	binary files, they were either converted from Binary to Foto directly with On
	Three's  Communications Manager or by pulling them into Graphics Manager and
	then saving them back to disk (Com Manager and Graphics Manager are both
	available from On Three).

	You can pull any of these 33 block FOTO files into Graphics Manager, Draw On
	Three, Sketchpad or other Apple /// graphics program and work with them as
	you would any other graphics file (But you will see a big difference).
	 However Menu.Maker does not seem to want to display them, nor does the
	Slideshow Program.  Any solutions to that are welcome.

	These disks are an effort to continue making updated programs and files
	available to Apple /// enthusiasts.  We hope you enjoy them!

	PDS Name: QUICKIE SCANNED GRAPHICS
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-GRX-24
	Bootable? Not Bootable

	April 28, 1991

	On this disk you will find a number of scanned graphics, obtained by using
	the Vitesse "Quickie" hand scanner in //e emulation mode.  Many of these
	graphics have a "college theme" as they were pulled from a catalog featuring
	various college newspapers.  But you may also enjoy the WAP logo we've
	included.

	How were these graphics converted to the Apple ///?  It was a fairly
	straightforward process that used an Apple /// with the Titan ///+//e
	cards and a 65c02 CPU chip.  The Quickie runs perfectly under emulation and
	provides Double Hi Res graphics 33 blocks long.  Saved to disk, each binary
	file was then pulled into the /// in native mode using On Three's Graphics
	Manager program (it will directly load 33 block Binary Double Hi Res Graphics
	files). Whatever cleaning up that was needed was then done in Graphics
	Manager.

	Then the file was saved to disk as a 33 block Apple /// FOTO file.

	Here are the graphics on this disk:

	APPLE-3-WAP-GRX-28:  Grafixworks Disk 1
	NOT Bootable


	GrafixWorks is a set of two double-sided disks that include a number of Apple
	/// Fotofiles you can use to help in designing, drawing and producing your own
	graphics.  There are a number of templates, drawing aids and even a few examples
	to help you.

	TO USE GRAFIXWORKS YOU WILL NEED AN APPLE /// OR ///+ COMPUTER, DRAWING PROGRAM
	AND PRINTER.  YOU MAY ALSO WISH TO HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER GRAPHICS AND FONTS.

	THIS IS A SHAREWARE PRODUCT.  PLEASE FOLLOW DISK INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU CHOOSE TO
	USE THESE DISKS.

	THE FILES

	All of the Fotofiles on these disks were made using On Three's Graphics Manager.
	It allows you to do a tremendous amount of work with graphics and print them out
	easily and quickly.  Used with On Three's Draw On ///, the PD program Sketchpad,
	or any other Apple /// or Apple // graphics program (up to Double HiRes), it is
	a powerful tool you can use for a number of projects.

	Here's what this disk contains:


	Side One            EXPLANATION

	THIN.LINE           Thin Line Border
	DOUBLE.LINE         Double Line Border
	THICK.LINE          Thick Line Border
	WICKER              A basic Wicker design
	WICKER2             Variation of Wicker
	WICKER3             Third variation of Wicker
	WICKER.BORDER       Example of a border using Wicker
	WICKER.BORDER2      Second example of a border using Wicker

	Side Two            DESCRIPTION

	BARS.1              Bars - Various widths; Same Lengths
	BARS.2              Bars - Various widths; Same Heights
	BARS.3              Bars - Various widths; 1/2 length of Bars.1
	BOXES.RECS          Boxes and Rectangles
	CUBE                A Cube Design
	CUBE.LH             Example of using Cube Design to start a border/letterhead
	RECTANGLES.1        Rectangles - Thin Line
	RECTANGLES.2        Rectangles - Thick Line


	Many of these designs were inspired by Broderbund's Printshop (tm) program for
	the Apple //.  But the designs work just as well for you in /// mode.  Use them
	for ideas, adapt them to your own use or use them as is.

	The GrafixWorks PaperTemplates can be used to help you with your graphics
	development.  There's a Blank.Labels file you can load, place it into the Paper
	Template of Graphics Manager and then load graphics and fonts to develop a
	custom label you can capture and copy to each of the six boxes before printing
	them out.

	PDS NAME: DINO Graphics
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-GRX-31
	BOOTABLE? Self-booting

	        This disk has lots of fun dinosaur graphics that your children
	can enjoy in any number of ways.  Here are some suggestions:

	1)  Print out the graphic "Dino.Swamp" in large format and let your kids
	    color it with crayons or markers.  Print out the dinosaurs in small
	    format. Color them and cut them out. The kids can then move the
	    dinosaurs around the swamp for some great dino-play.

	2)  Print out the dinosaurs in large or small format and color them in
	    funny patterns.

	3)  After printing, your child can (with your help if necessary
	    print the proper name under each dinosaur.

	4)  Load a dinosaur into On Three's Graphics Manager or Draw On Three and
	    have your child give thoughts about it.  Type those thoughts under the
	    dinosaur, print, color and post (or send to grandma!).


	On Side ONE You'll Find These Graphics:

	TYRANA           :Tyrannosaurus
	BRONTA           :Brontasaurus
	STEGA            :Stegosaurus


	On Side TWO You'll Find These Graphics:


	TRI              :Triceratops
	DIMA             :Dimetrodon
	TRI.BABY         :Triceratops Baby
	PTERA            :Pteradactle
	DINO.BOOKMARK    :A Dinosaur Bookmark
	DINO.SWAMP       :A Swamp Just Right for Dinosaurs



	These graphics were all scanned into an Apple //gs computer using the Quickie
	Hand Scanner and ProDos 8 (Apple //e) version software.  We've found that
	the ProDos 8 software is quicker and easier to use for scanning these graphics
	into memory as a 33 block Double HiRes graphic/Binary File (as opposed to the
	GSOS version of the software).

	The graphic is saved to a 3.5" disk and then switched to a 512k Apple ///+
	equipped with an Apple //e Unidrive.  Loaded into Graphics Manager, the Apple
	// Double HiRes Binary File becomes an Apple /// Fotofile.  It is then
	cleaned up and processed into the final Fotofile that is found on this disk.

	Note that due to the requirements of the SCR.PRT.INV invokable (the assembly
	language module that lets us print these graphics to your printer), the
	graphics on screen appear in INVERSE mode.  Printed, they are in NORMAL mode.

	As set up on this disk, you can print to a SERIAL printer in EPSON emulation
	mode from the RS232/Serial Port on the back of your ///.  Be sure to copy
	your own SOS.Driver file (set up for your system's printer) to a copy of this
	disk so you can print your graphics properly.)(Remember the default seting is
	".Printer").

	PDS NAME: BOOKPLATE Graphics
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-GRX-32
	BOOTABLE? Self-booting


	        The bookplates on this disk began life as a printed graphic that
	was scanned using a Quickie Hand Scanner attached to an Apple //gs.  Saved
	as an Apple // Double HiRes 33 block Binary File, each graphic was then
	loaded into an Apple /// using On Three's Graphics Manager and converted to
	an Apple /// FotoFile.  Graphics Manager was used to clean each bookplate
	up a bit and then saved to disk.  Whew!
	        This process does not result in a graphic with high resolution.  If
	there was a driver and software to use the Quickie in the ///, the resolution
	would probably be better (anyone interested?).  But I think you'll agree
	these are of pretty good quality and fun to print out and use.
	        Print these bookplates "small" and "centered" for best results (left
	is OK too...).  Large mode could be used for a book cover or ??  Use your
	imagination!
	        Note that on Side Two there's a "videoplate" to use with your video
	tapes (VIDEO.TAPEPLATE).  We've also included Slideshow3 so you can look at
	all the graphics in slideshow fashion and Print.Show which will print all
	the graphics for you at one time.  Of course Menu.Maker 6.1 will let you
	look at one graphic at a time and print one out at a time as well.

	        APPLE-3-WAP-GRX-33 is a disk full of animal pictures.  As with many of our other
	graphics offerings, this one includes FOTOfiles scanned into a //GS using a
	Quickie brand scanner, saved to 3.5" disk and then pulled into our SARA with
	On Three's Graphics Manager.
	        This disk includes 4 FOTOfiles of various fishes, 2 cats, a bunny and
	a hare.  The pictures originated from a "Treasury of Animal Illustrations"
	from 18th Century Sources" edited by Carol Belanger Grafton. Our many many
	thanks to Nancy Sefarian of the Pi for making this book (and many others)
	containing public domain graphics and illustrations to the /// SIG.
	        The program Print.Show is on side one so that you may print all the
	FOTOfiles if you like.
	        We hope you enjoy this disk and are always open to suggestions for
	any other graphics offerings!
	        Many thanks to WAP member Nancy Sefarian for making these graphics
	available to us!

	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-GRX-34
	BOOTABLE? Self Booting


	Artworks is a fun Pascal-based graphics program you may enjoy trying - but
	you'll have to work at it a bit to use.

	You can use On Three's Trackball /// with this program but it will not work
	(as written) with a joystick.  The arrow keys work just fine to get you
	around the graphics screen.

	Artworks originated from TAU, the Third Apple Users Group in Wheaton
	(Chicago), Illinois, but we don't know who the actual author is.

	On Side One:

	Artworks.Help  :Artworks information and user manual.
	Artworks.Text  :ASCII version of Artworks Source Code.
	Demo.Pic       :Demonstration graphic created with Artworks.

	On Side Two:

	Artworks Boot/Program disk.  Pascal Text File version of the programs
	Source Code is also on this side.

	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-GRX-35
	BOOTABLE? Self Booting


	        3D Graphics is an interesting, tho limited, Business Basic drawing
	program. As noted by our good Canadian friend C.M. Davidson:

	The program "Graph.3D" is one I picked up a couple of years ago at a local
	swap meet from somebody who had no idea what it is or does, or where it came
	from.  I think it is a local amateur attempt to design a drawing program
	using a Joystick.  Not having a joystick, I have never run the program
	successfully. Perhaps you can do more with it, and eventually put it on a WAP
	PD disk.  Good Luck!

	Martin Davidson
	Burlington, Ont., Canada
	6 April 1992.


	On Side One:

	GRAPH.3D.TEXT:   ASCII text version of the 3D Graphics program.
	TUTORIAL     :   Tutorial on how to use 3D Graphics

	On Side Two  :

	3D Graphics Program along with a couple of FOTOfiles you can load if desired.

	NOTE that this program can not PRINT FOTOfiles in its present form.  But it
	can SAVE them.  We've included our Menu.Maker program on this disk which can
	LOAD and PRINT FOTOfiles as well as Print.Show, a program that will allow you
	to print FOTOfiles from any disk or disks you like.

	BOOTABLE? BOOTABLE - Side One

	SEPTEMBER, 1995 Update


	This New Member Disk (sides one and two) contains a wealth of information
	for new members of Washington Apple Pi's /// SIG.

	It's specifically a resource for anyone new to Apple /// computers and
	you should read it carefully and completely.  The Menu.Maker program
	makes it easy to do that.  And it also lets you make a hard copy
	of any text file you wish, simply by answering "Y" or '"y" at the
	appropriate prompt (assuming you have an Epson compatable serial printer
	hooked up to your ///'s serial port ... the 25 pin connector ...in the back
	 of the ///)(We have drivers for other printers.)

	Additionally, if you have Apple Writer, Word Juggler or ///
	EZ Pieces (or for that matter, an Apple // with a ProDos-based word
	processor or Mac with Apple File Exchange and a way to get these files
	onto a 3.5 disk) you can read these text files as well.

	This disk is but one of a growing /// SIG Public Domain resource designed
	just for you.  On side two, you will find a brief description of
	our PD disks.  But PD disks APPLE-3-WAP-cat-01-03 contain a complete listing of all that
	our library has to offer, and we recommend them to you!

	Obviously we may have missed something.  If so, come to our next meeting and
	let's talk about it!

	We should also mention that there is an Apple /// in the WAP office.  We have
	many software packages, books, software manuals, even a tutorial video tape
	(VHS) or tutorial cassettes which you may take out and view or listen to.

	Again, welcome to Washington Apple Pi and the /// SIG! We'll look forward to
	meeting you in person at our next meeting (quarterly on the second Saturday
	at 10:00 AM at the Washington Apple Pi office.

	PDS NAME: Information from The Source
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-INF-04
	BOOTABLE: Side One


	May, 1987
	Updated a tad - March, 1995


	The information on this disk is material originally downloaded by
	various people from The Source, an online information
	service that no longer exists. As originally placed into the
	public domain, the information was basically in its raw, unedited form
	and contained a great deal of material that is no longer relavent to the
	Apple /// community.

	The Apple /// SIG of Washington Apple Pi has taken the original material as
	found in the "Information from The Source" public domain disk and edited it
	down considerably to remove extraneous matter.  Much of the information is
	very useful.  However, given the fact that the material comes from 1982, we
	would remind users of this disk that names and addresses are probably
	out-of-date and that some vendors mentioned either no longer exist, no longer
	offer a particular program or have been absorbed into another company
	(VisiCorp is a good example.  It was bought out by Lotus Development and
	Visicalc was subsequently retired).  For an up-to-date listing of vendors,
	please check your /// SIG New Members Disk (III.INF.01).

	We feel there is still a great deal of excellent information contained on the
	disk and hope you will find it useful.

	As always, the /// SIG welcomes your comments and suggestions and welcomes
	any thoughts for future additions to our SIG library.


	One Side One you'll find:

	ACCESS.REVIEW :  A review of Access III V. 1.0
	ACCESS.TECH   :  Technical notes on Access III V. 1.0
	APPLEIII.Q.A. :  Apple /// Q and A on topics that include
	                 Apple // emulation, Quark, Super Serial Cards, etc.
	PARALLEL.CARD :  Interactive Structures Parallel Interface for the ///.
	READ.ME.FIRST :  Some initial notes about the information on this disk.
	MESSAGE.CENTER  :Some /// information originally found on The Source.
	PROFILE.DAT.SAV :Review of the Profile Data Saver program for use with
	                 PFS.

	On Side Two:

	COPYRIGHT.INFO   :Tutorial on copyrights for computer programs and Databases.
	MARILYN          :Fotofile of that famous actress.
	MORE.A3.Q.A      :Discussions include Pascal, SOSclock, CP/M and more.
	AWRITER.REVIEW   :A not-so-positive review of Applewriter 1.0.
	WJUGGLER.REVIEW  :A review of Word Juggler
	XEBEC.HRD.DISK   :Fairly positive review of a hard drive made by Xebec.

	THE CONTENTS OF THIS DISK INCLUDE SOME OF THE BEST ARTICLES, INFORMATION,
	EDITORIALS, ETC. FROM THE ATUNC NEWSLETTER, THE PUBLICATION OF THE APPLE
	THREE USERS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

	This "Best Of" disk is only one of a series of such disks developed for the
	WAP /// SIG (and other Apple /// Users Groups) to provide /// users with a
	quick reference to a wide range of /// information.  All "Best Of" disks may
	not necessarily follow the same format.  For instance, this disk simply
	contains a number of articles by subject.  For example, "A3 Notes" or
	"Bus(iness) Graphics.

	Thanks to former ///ers Robert Howell, the /// SIG PD now boasts of a
	tremendous resource - a series of "Best of ATUNC" disks by category to make
	finding information even easier for you.  They are disks APPLE-3-WAP-INF-06 through 11.
	All are available from the WAP office at reasonable cost.

	PDS NAME : OMNIS 3 TECH NOTES
	DISK ID  : APPLE-3-WAP-INF-15
	BOOTABLE ? Side One Only


	Notes as originally complied by:

	D A DataSystems
	3792 Windover Dr.
	Hamburg, NY  14075
	716-648-2462

	(DA Datasystems no longer exists - all its programs were placed into the PD)


	Introducing OMNIS 3 for the Apple ///

	OMNIS 3 has been available for the Apple /// for almost 4 years (we saw an
	advertisement in an old 1981 British Apple magazine); and it has gained a
	reputation over those years as being one of the most powerful Database
	Managers available for the machine.

	Unfortunately it also gained a reputation for carrying with it a somewhat
	"inaccessible" User Manual. Mostly this was a result of two things. The
	system was originally developed in Britain and the examples in the manual
	(and marketing literature) occasionally slip into Pounds and British Postal
	codes and similar idioms which often add an extra level of potential
	mis-understanding to the otherwise quite complete examples. Additionally the
	system was originally developed under the UCSD Pascal System which allowed
	eventual "ports" of the program to the wide variety of machines appearing on
	the scene in those halcyon days of the early 80's. (Nowadays you just do an
	IBM and maybe a Mac version ...sigh). This led to a manual that was scattered
	with notes to the effect that 'Apple ][ users should ignore the next
	paragraph', 'Apple /// users should skip this section...' and similar
	interruptions of the reading.

	Additionally I also felt, personally, that the TUTORIAL approach taken by the
	documentation was inadequate - I don't like tutorials and rarely have the
	patience to take the time to walk through them; the resulting "dartboard"
	attempts to use the program can be frustrating.

	Well the program developers, Blythe Software (now with California Offices)
	recognized this but took a quite realistic look at the Apple /// market of
	1985 and hesitated. They have recently released a MacIntosh version of OMNIS
	3 which is drawing RAVE reviews across the board. Their early (premature ?)
	release of an OMNIS 2 for the Mac in the first mac-month with the original
	documentation was roundly panned. So for the new Mac version they did a
	re-write of the entire manual; the result is, we are told, quite well done.
	They did not feel the potential Apple /// sales volume justified a similar
	re-write and neither do we.

	But we did still consider OMNIS the most powerful DBMS for the /// - if a bit
	pricey for an "orphan" market.

	Hence the "Revival" on our part of the program in November 1985 and the 50%
	list price reduction (tied, naturally, to some "cross-your-fingers" type
	volume commitments). We have tentatively agreed to take over technical and
	customer support for the /// version from Blythe and will be contacting the
	current users with various support options. In addition we have set about to
	creating a set of ADDENDA to the User Manual in the form of the enclosed
	"TECH NOTES". We will be adding to these and definitely request and expect
	your feedback to this series - such a multi-faceted product can only be
	adequately supported if it stands upon a wide-ranging usage base. We cannot
	alone run OMNIS through all its paces and thus need YOUR feedback and
	comments on YOUR applications to guide us in supporting you and the entire
	user base.

	RECOMMENDATION

	Well I hate to say it but the TECH NOTES series is not a substitute for a
	re-write of the manual. You've just GOT to read the ENTIRE manual first; and
	we cannot see a better, more complete introduction to the program than the
	TUTORIAL...

	Having done it ourselves the hard way we suggest that the extra time spent
	plodding through the tutorial/manual now will save hours of thumbing through
	it later - this really is a tremendously flexible and powerful program which
	you probably will build a large percentage of your Apple /// usage around.
	Acknowledging the flaws and occasional omissions of the manual up front we
	still cannot see how you can fill in the holes without knowing the road. So
	we recommend the following "startup" process.

	1. Install the system in your floppy or hard-disk based system using the
	guidelines in the manual. Read the /// notes in the manual. Read our NOTES
	#1, 9 and 10 if applicable.

	2. Scan through the entire manual to get a feel primarily for its style and
	general terminology. You will probably find that the regular linking of
	descriptions to specifics of the ongoing tutorial/example makes this stage
	difficult.

	3. Now scan through our TECH NOTES so you will have a sense of when a
	particular note should be pulled up in the following steps.

	4. Read through the entirety of the User manual WHILE setting up the sample
	application described in the manual. Take a few 1-2 hour daily sessions to do
	this.

	5. Now delete those sample files and go ahead and create your own TEST
	database application. We suggest a simple, single-file Address Book with
	indexes on Last Name and Zip and simple reports including one label-style and
	one 'boilerplate' letter type. If you maintain name & address data you may
	wish to move that data into this application via a DIF file format if
	available.

	6. Read through the TECH NOTES again.

	7. Finally sit down and DESIGN your first production application ON PAPER.
	Draw up lists of fields and field attributes and sketch our some Entry
	Formats for data entry & retrieval. We strongly recommend a simple "flat
	file" for now. Unless necessary for the initial application try to avoid
	multiple connected files; usually you can work with 2 or 3 single
	applications first then later connect them appropriately. Keep in mind that
	OMNIS is quite flexible in allowing re-configuring of most anything down the
	line (you just need some patience for those long - overnight - file reorgs
	!).

	8. You WILL get stalled at times; you will find some elements to be pretty
	obscure as you read & work with them. Give yourself some time climbing this

	        TAU - The Third Apple User's Group - was a wonderful group that
	provided many years of strong support to the Apple /// family. They no
	longer exist - but their legacy of newsletters and disks do. Following
	up on our APPLE-3-WAP-INF-05 "Best Of" disk - we're putting ALL the newsletters
	we have available from them into our PD. It was at the request of the
	WAP /// SIG that they make these disks available. Sadly, Vol. 1 was
	NOT available on disk BUT we do have them on paper. Let your SIG know
	if you are interested. We also have their newsletters published AFTER
	these disks - but the disks in this series cover the main years that TAU
	was primarily an Apple /// group.


	On Side One:

	Informational files about TAU - from 1987. The group no longer exists.

	OLD.TAU.LIBRARY   : What the original TAU PD Library offered in 1987

	             September/October 1995

	Welcome to the WAP Apple Family Internet Starter Kit!

	We've attempted to compile literally a ton of information for you about
	the Internet and how you can use it with your Appe II or /// computer.
	That's right - literally ALL Apple IIs - from the Plus on up to the GS and
	any version of the /// - can and do have the ability to surf the Internet.
	It's not as pretty as the Macs and PCs can do these days with their Web
	Surfers, etc. BUT computers were accessing the Internet for years before
	these latest software goodies ever showed up. And besides - you don't
	need the memory or special software that the newer machines need.

	These disks are a work in progress - please let us know how we can
	improve them for you. IF you would like to contribute more to them, or
	make some adjustements here and there, please let us know. We want
	these disks to be a wonderful resource to the entire Apple II family!

	Welcome to the WAP Apple Family Internet Starter Kit!

	We've attempted to compile literally a ton of information for you about
	the Internet and how you can use it with your Appe II or /// computer.
	That's right - literally ALL Apple IIs - from the Plus on up to the GS and
	any version of the /// - can and do have the ability to surf the Internet.
	It's not as pretty as the Macs and PCs can do these days with their Web
	Surfers, etc. BUT computers were accessing the Internet for years before
	these latest software goodies ever showed up. And besides - you don't
	need the memory or special software that the newer machines need.

	These disks are a work in progress - please let us know how we can
	improve them for you. IF you would like to contribute more to them, or
	make some adjustements here and there, please let us know. We want
	these disks to be a wonderful resource to the entire Apple II family!

	APPLE II FAMLY INTERNET STARTER'S KIT

	Compiled by: David Ottalini
	             WAP /// SIG Co-Chairman
	             September/October 1995

	Welcome to the WAP Apple Family Internet Starter Kit!

	We've attempted to compile literally a ton of information for you about
	the Internet and how you can use it with your Appe II or /// computer.
	That's right - literally ALL Apple IIs - from the Plus on up to the GS and
	any version of the /// - can and do have the ability to surf the Internet.
	It's not as pretty as the Macs and PCs can do these days with their Web
	Surfers, etc. BUT computers were accessing the Internet for years before
	these latest software goodies ever showed up. And besides - you don't
	need the memory or special software that the newer machines need.

	These disks are a work in progress - please let us know how we can
	improve them for you. IF you would like to contribute more to them, or
	make some adjustements here and there, please let us know. We want
	these disks to be a wonderful resource to the entire Apple II family!

	PDS NAME: BREAD RECIPES
	DISK ID : 3MSC.12
	BOOTABLE? SIDE ONE


	OK - so I'll admit I wanted to do this disk because I got a bread maker
	for Christmas, 1993.  But it's also a fact that I've loved to make and
	bake bread for many years. It's a challenge that I master most - but not
	all of the time!  And anything I can do - or find - to help is welcomed.

	Thus - the bread maker - and - the bread recipes.  You'll find a host
	of them on this disk. They're all in ASCII text format so they can be
	read on any Apple // family machine or a Mac LC with a // card and
	drive installed.  They can be pulled into Appleworks or 3EZ Pieces if
	you like as well to help with sorting - though I did not design these
	files specifically for that (I would have given it to you in that
	format if I had).

	As with most of our disks, you can look at each recipe individually
	using our Menu.Maker program and print it if you like.  OR you can
	use the "Print.All" program to do just that - print all text files on both
	sides.

	Let us know what you think of these and contribute your own if you like.
	IF we get enough, maybe there'll be enough for another disk. Most of
	the material here, by the way, came courtesy of CompuServe's Cooks
	Forum. (Thankyou!).

	This disk contains the disk catalog of Pair Software - a former Apple
	/// vendor.

	We've placed this disk into the WAP /// SIG PD for a couple of reasons.
	One is historical. It's important to preserve the information about the products
	listed here. Secondly, this company made an important and lasting contribution
	to the /// community and deserves that recognition.  We also think it's
	interesting to read the descriptions... and see what the going prices were just
	a few years ago.

	Please note that in late 1993, Frank Moore (former CEO of Pair Software)
	put all his disks into the public domain by donating them to WAP.

	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-PCL-07
	BOOTABLE?: Nonbootable

	DESCRIPTION:

	The Apple /// Pascal Utility Library is meant to provide the knowledgeable A3
	Pascal programmer with the tools needed to write sophisticated programs for

	any application. The aim is to free the programmer from tedious coding of
	details so that he can concentrate on program function.

	To this end, the Pascal Utility Library id divided into three main groups of
	modules:

	- The General Utility modules relieve the burden of writing the
	general-purpose routines needed for user-program interaction, error-checking,
	and data conversion.

	- The file Access modules are a powerful tool for consistent handling of data
	files.

	- The B-tree modules combine features of sequential and binary tree access to
	provide a means of sorting and searching through data in memory.  The
	underlying data structure is flexible enough to accomodate any key length
	from 1 to 16 bytes.

	The TESTUNIT program provided with this package will permit you to observe
	the effect of calling the modules with specific parameter values. In an
	application program, it remains the programmer's responsibility to call the
	modules properly as defined in the documentation. This will encourage
	well-organized, readable code.

	Requires knowledge of Pascal to use.  The WAP /// SIG has many copies of the
	Pascal manuals. Call the office for details. The manual for this disk is
	available for the cost of copying. Contact Dave Ottalini for details at
	301-681-6136.

	PDS NAME: Wade's Pascal Patch/PCode Disassembler
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-PCL-08
	BOOTABLE? Nonbootable

	DESCRIPTION: Side One has Dan Wade's Pascal Patch program:

	*Now Version 2.0!

	The purpose of super PMOVE is simple- To move the Apple /// Pascal
	SYSTEM files (SYSTEM.PASCAL, SYSTEM.FILER, SYSTEM.COMPILER, etc.) from
	the crowded root directory of a hard disk volume (50 files maximum) to
	an uncrowded sub-directory file (2nd level only!) on that volume.
	This action gives you more room in the root directory for other
	programs that need root directory space.

	The program assumes that you have already upgraded your system to
	Pascal 1.2, and used its PMOVE program to place the Pascal
	SOS.INTERPreter's SYSTEM file presumptions from .D1 to the root
	directory of your hard disk volume.  SUPER PMOVE will 'patch' the
	SOS.INTERPreter to look to a new sub-directory named by you (I
	strongly suggest the name of SYS1.2 [i.e., <device name>/SYS1.2]),
	then transfer the root directory SYSTEM files to the sub-directory.
	Once done, the root directory files can be deleted.

	The program is self documented, with help screens.

	Side Two has a p-Code Disassembler - which creates Op-Codes from Pascal
	code files. Not Self-Booting.

	PDS NAME: CHAOS PROGRAMS IN PASCAL
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-PCL-09
	BOOTABLE? YES


	Disk by C.M.Davidson
	February, 1991

	INTRODUCTION


	This disk contains several programs for drawing some of the familiar icons of
	chaos theory: MANDELBROT graphs, FEIGENBAUM diagrams and LORENZ attractors.
	The material draws very heavily on the book:

	     Dynamical Systems and Fractals - Computer Experiments in Pascal.

	                  by

	     Karl-Heinz Becker and Michael Doerfler
	     Cambridge University Press (1989)

	     ISBN 0 521 36910 X (paperback).

	Needless to say, alas, Apple /// Pascal is NOT one of the dialects treated by
	the authors (IBM, Macintosh and Amiga are the favoured machines), but some
	information is provided on Apple ][ Pascal application - from which I have
	adapted the programs here.


	DISK ORGANIZATION.

	Side 1 contains three Pascal codefiles and this information file:

	MANDELPROG.CODE when executed prompts the user for the leftmost, rightmost
	and bottom limits of the field to be scanned.  It then sets the top limit to
	maintain the diagram proportions and plots the area of the Mandelbrot diagram
	covered (this can take several hours!).  Finally it saves the diagram as a
	Pascal DATAfile in the active directory under the name 'MANDELBROT.PIC' and
	is returned to the Pascal Command level by hitting 'RETURN'.

	FULLMANDEL.PIC (on side 2) illustrates the complete Mandelbrot diagram for
	all areas of interest.  It was created as a Pascal DATAfile and converted to
	a FOTOfile for ease of viewing with the Basic Menu program.


	FEIGENPROG.CODE when executed prompts the user for the left, right, bottom
	and top limits of the field of interest, as well as for two more variables
	which determine respectively how many iterations will be performed before
	points are plotted, and how many points will be plotted, in each
	generation.  It then computes the necessary iterative calculations and plots
	the FEIGENBAUM BIFURCATION diagram for the field specified, saves the diagram
	and its variables as 'FEIGENBAUM.PIC' and awaits a 'RETURN' to return to the
	Pascal command level.

	FEIGEN.PIC (Side 2) illustrates an overview of the diagram, between the
	limits shown.

	LORENZPROG.CODE when executed prompts for the three parameters A, B and C of
	the differential equations used by Lorenz in his discussion of the
	instability of simple systems:

	     x' = A*(y-x)
	     y' = B*x-y-x*z
	     z' = x*y-C*z

	then proceeds to plot the movement of a point subject to these constraints as
	it succeeds or fails in finding a stable locus; most often its track
	oscillates between two separate loops in the well-known 'butterfly' figure.
	The plot is interrupted by any keystroke, upon which the program saves its
	diagram under the name LORENZ.PIC in the active directory, and returns to the
	command level after 'RETURN' is pressed.

	LORENZ.PIC (Side 2) illustrates a typical shape for the Lorenz Attractor.


	Side 2 also contains two subdirectories of Pascal source code - FULLTEXTS and
	FRAGMENTS.

	FULLTEXTS contains the main text files (their names are self-explanatory)
	from which each of the three programs is compiled, as well as a skeleton text
	file for use in generating other programs.  Each of these text files uses
	{$INCLUDE} commands to incorporate a common file of utilities and a file
	specific to the main text being compiled.  These are all found in the
	subdirectory FRAGMENTS.

	PDS NAME: Pascal Menu.Maker
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-PCL-10
	BOOTABLE?: Bootable

	This disk contains a wonderful Pascal version of the venable Basic Menu.Maker
	program found on most WAP /// SIG PD disks.  A former /// SIGer -
	Tom Bartkiewitz - wrote this program from scratch.  The program can be
	loaded onto a hard disk and used like any other. It can run any
	Pascal program, read text and 3 EZP/AW files, change fonts, etc.

	Since this is a Pascal-based program, you must first boot side one
	and then flip over the disk to side 2 and hit <RETURN>. From there, you
	can
	create a menu from any disk you might have.  It can read any Pascal text,
	ASCII, or 3EZ Pieces text file (that's right....3 EZPs!). It will also run
	any pascal-based program you might have.  Since this is not an
	assembly-language program like Selector or Catalyst, however, it will NOT run
	a Basic or other language program.  The program is unprotected and source
	code is included and fully documented.

	Just like the Basic version of Menu.Maker, when booted, you will get
	our standard hello message (written by Jim Salerno).  From there, you are
	taken immediately into Menu.Maker and your menu of the disk in .D1 (that is,
	the PD Menu.Maker disk).  The Side 2 menu includes the following:


	SYSTEM.LIBRARY      Code
	HELLO.TEXT          Text
	FONTS               Catalog
	PRINT.TEXT          Text
	SYSTEM.STARTUP      Code
	MENU.MAKER.CODE     Code
	PROGRAMS            Catlog
	PRINT.CODE          Code


	At the bottom of the screen you are told to press the Open Apple key
	and "?" for help and the <ESCAPE> key to exit the program (and return to
	the
	Pascal command line).  The Help file is a window laid over the first screen
	and gives the date and time, as well as a number of options available to the
	user.  It describes the various actions taken by highlighting a Code, Font,
	Catalog, Ascii, Text or 3 EZP word processing file.  In addition, by pressing
	Open Apple and "S", Menu.Maker will display the system memory map.  Here,
	you'll find out how much RAM is available in your Apple ///; how much is in
	use; how much memory SOS is taking up; how much memory the Interpreter is
	taking up; and finally, how much is available to the user.

	Open Apple and "V" displays and allows the user to select the
	available "block" devices (like .D1; .D2; .Profile, etc.). By moving the
	cursor and highlighting the desired device and pressing <RETURN>, you can
	change the prefix and Menu.Maker will give you the menu on that device
	(based, of course, on what drivers you loaded at bootup)! You can then read
	files or run the programs from that new prefix!

	The Pascal Menu.Maker can load and display any font you desire
	quickly and easily (it really "glides" from one to another). This disk
	includes some fonts for you to test out.  The print program was added by ///
	SIG member Jim Salerno, so you can print out any file on the disk.  The
	Programs catalog includes a Pascal program to set the date and time.  By the
	way, when these programs end, you will be returned to the Pascal command
	line.  To rerun Menu.Maker, type "X" and then ".D2/Menu.Maker.Code" and
	.

	On Side 1 of this disk, along with the boot files, you will find
	two Sources catalogs.  These contain a number of text, ascii and a 3EZP word
	processing file with information pertaining to the disk, and other useful
	material.  You will want to read the Sources.Text file, which explains
	everything on the disk in much greater detail that I can do here.  Everything
	is explained in full detail, and anyone who enjoys Pascal prgramming will
	have no trouble following what Tom has done.

	By the way, this program is easily installed for use under either
	Catalyst or Selector.  You could also use it as a "turn-key" disk for
	specific Pascal programs you might wish to run or files you wanted to read.
	To make this disk more useful for that purpose, please remove all the
	extraneous files included on this disk (source code files, etc.).

	DESCRIPTION: Disks APPLE-3-WAP-PCL-13, 14 and 15 are some of the nuggets we got from a
	donation by Joe Dobrowolski (of Apple Users Group International). We
	call them "David Craig Disks 1,2 and 3" since the material on these disks
	were all placed into the PD by ///er David Craig. All require knowledge of
	Pascal to operate properly.

	On Side One:
	-: EMUL.ROM   : Disassembled source code listing for the A ][ Emulation ROM
	-:              for the ///.
	-: SAVAGE     : Floating point benchmark program which tests the accuracy of
	-:              the transcendental functions.
	-: UDEBUG     : Runtime debugger which uses an external terminal.Used by most
	-:              of my programs since I rarely write a program which runs
	-:              correctly the first time.
	-: USINCOS    : Nice Pascal unit for generating sine and cosine values.

	-: On Side Two:
	-: ASMFORMAT0.TEXT
	-: ASMFORMAT1.TEXT
	-: ASMFORMAT2.TEXT
	-: ASMFORMAT3.TEXT
	-: ASMFORMAT4.TEXT
	-: ASMFORMAT5.TEXT
	-: (ASMFORMAT : Formats assembler listing files so that all back-patches are
	-:              correctly patched. Nice utility for the /// assembly people.)

	PDS NAME: IEEE-488 FILES FOR THE APPLE // AND ///
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-PCL-16
	BOOTABLE? Bootable


	By Jim Trezzo

	Compiled and edited by Dave Ottalini - WAP /// SIG


	This disk contains the software to support the IEEE-488 card from Pascal and
	FORTRAN.  It takes the form of an application note; source listings, informal
	documentation (no manual) and a diskette.

	The software consists of two separate parts.  One part is written in Pascal
	as a Pascal unit.  This unit (GPIB.CODE) contains higher level
	functions available to the Pascal or FORTRAN application program.

	The second part of the software takes the form of an attached driver to the
	Pascal BIOS.  This driver (I488) is written in TLA assembler code.  The
	Pascal unit GPIB, which supports the higher level functions, relies on low
	level functions provided by the attached device driver.  Low level functions
	such as UNITCLEAR, UNITREAD, UNITWRITE and UNITSTATUS are provided by the
	driver.  All communication with the IEEE-488 card will be through the driver.


	On Side One:


	Read.Me.A2   : Information about the Apple // IEEE-488 software.
	Read.Me.A3   : Information about the Apple /// IEEE-488 software.

	PDS NAME: PASCAL
	MODULES FOR DEVELOPERS
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-PCL-20
	BOOTABLE: Not Bootable - requires Pascal

	This disk includes a number of Pascal Modules you can use to help you
	as a developer.  Below is a list of each file and a short description
	of what each one does.  IF you use any of these to develop a program
	for the Apple /// we hope you'll share it with the rest of the ///
	Community!


	SIDE ONE:


	CRT.LIB.TEXT

	  Pascal screen control library utility routines for Apple ///.
	  Created to control cursor functions use interfaces in
	  CURSOR_LIB.          By E.J. Fournier


	CURSOR.LIB.TEXT

	  Pascal cursor control library utility routines for Apple ///.
	  Created to control screen/viewport functions use
	  interfaces in CRT.LIB.      By E.J. Fournier


	WINDOW.BOR.TEXT

	  The code was created as a result of not having the "chr()"
	  character definitions for the characters used in the FORM program in
	  the XA7 library.  The routine could be expanded to include other character
	  shapes to make a more interesting border but the border created using
	  standard characters and this one special character is really sufficient.
	  By E.J. Fournier


	PAS.WINDOW.TEXT

	  I started writing a few more programming utilities and came across
	  the controls to save and restore the screen.  I decided to experiment
	  and the result is the code shown below.  I realize the experiment
	  itself is of no real use but it demonstrates some of the speed with
	  which you can manipulate the screen and some of the possibilities that
	  exist for window manipulation.  You can save screens in memory and
	  instantaneously display them rather than write them to the screen.
	  Consider their use in the FORM program (those of you that have down-
	  loaded it).  Anyway, compile this and use the cursor keys to move the
	  window around.  Use ESC to quit.  Consider as you use the arrows that
	  your restoring the entire screen and the small window as you move about
	  By the way, you're expected to have the CURSOR and CRT libraries in the
	  SYSTEM.LIBRARY                   By E.J. Fournier


	PSCL.SCRN.TEXT

	  Here are a few more screen utilities for those of you that do some PASCAL
	  programming.  I really started to do a window function that was going to
	  save window in dynamicly allocated memory with restoration by utilization
	  of a window number.  Unfortunately it just didn't work out and since I
	  had no use for it other than the thought that it would really be a neat
	  feature, I quit the effort.  If anyone thinks they can do it ( I was
	  planning on having a varient subrecord to conserve memory), let me know
	  how you make out.  All the parts are here.

	  P.S. You may want to combine these library routines.  I did them seperate
	  thinking they wouldn't all get loaded if only one was used.
	  By E.J. Fournier


	WINDOWUTIL.TEXT

	  I started writing a few more programming utilities and came across
	  the controls to save and restore the screen.  I decided to experiment
	  and the result is the code shown below.  I realize the experiment
	  itself is of no real use but it demonstrates some of the speed with

	  SYSTEM.LIBRARY.                          By E.J. Fournier



	FONT.CAP.TEXT

	  This program will extract FONT character data from a SOS.DRIVER
	  file and then store the data in a new file for use by you.
	  If you plan to use the new FONT file with Business Basic,
	  use the PASCAL FILER to change the FONT storage file type from
	  a PASCAL data file to a FONTFILE...

	VIEWPRTPOS.TEXT

	  This is a collection of Pascal procedures used as screen utilities on the
	  Apple ///.  Also included are a few others such as one to clear the
	  input buffer. Submitted by Harry Baya, 72135,1667, 6/8/85

	PSCL.MOUSE.TEXT

	    This is a little graphics demo to show how the Mouse can be used in
	  Programming on the Apple ///.  This program requires that Applestuff,
	  Pgraf, and Psosio be located in the system library. Psosio is an implemen-
	  tation of SOS Commands straight from Pascal. It is part of the Pascal Tech
	  reference manual package. I only use it to get the SOS device number of the
	  Mouse Driver. The procedure Pnum then translates this into the Pascal Unit
	  number needed by the Unitstatus, Unitread, and Unitwrite commands.
	    The program is setup to run the BW 280 graphics mode. It allows the user
	  to do freehand drawing. The program will plot a point by pressing the mouse
	  button and by holding it down it will draw lines as fast as you move it,
	  but the faster you do the more jagged it becomes.


	   COMMANDS:                                        EFFECT:
	   Click the Mouse                                Plot a Point
	   Hold the Mouse Button Down                     Draws solid lines
	   Open-Apple X                                   Keeps X-Value Constant
	   Open-Apple Y                                   Keeps Y-Value Constant
	   Open-Apple C                                   Clears the Screen
	   Open-Apple S                                   Switch Between Screens
	   Open-Apple Q                                   Quits the Program

	     The Open-Apple X and Y commands are nice for plotting strictly horizon-
	  tal or vertical lines. One note is that these two commands stay in effect
	  until another key is pressed (i.e. the spacebar). Since I had the program
	  hang up every time I tried to write to the Mouse I decided to forego it at
	  this point. The net effect is that the Mouse will jump to a new position
	  when the Open-Apple X or Y command is terminated. Not a major problem but
	  still annoying.
	     Meanwhile enjoy playing Mouser for awhile. It's not quite a MAC and
	  thats a pleasing thought.

	  By: David Bixby    16 Mar 85

	PRINT.SCRN.TEXT

	  This program was taken in part from the window demo program by
	  E.Fournier.  I have added a Print Screen routine that will print the
	  buffer that contains the screens contents.  I have also added a
	  GET_KBD_BYTE routine that will return the first byte from the keyboard.
	  if you use this routine in your program you will always have the PRTSCR
	  routine if you press BOTH APPLES and the ENTER key (not the return key)

	  It would not be too much trouble to add a on-line notepad / calandar /
	  and other routines that would use a special keys.  If someone writes
	  some of these routines, Please upload them so everyone can use them.
	  This program uses the CRT.LIB that is in the data base so upload that
	  first to use this program.

	  TODD BLACKLEY  [72426.206]


	SIDE TWO


	An  assortment  of PASCAL utilities and input routines. Included are text
	input routines, long integer  conversion, SOS  time  and date, unitstatus
	calls  and  more.  Source included.

	PDS NAME : DISKCHECK and PROHEALTH
	Disk ID  : APPLE-3-WAP-REP-07
	BOOTABLE?  Both Sides


	        This disk has two programs you'll find to be very useful for
	protecting the health of your Profile/800K/floppy disk.  Thanks to TAU (Third
	Apple Users Group) for these programs:

	SIDE ONE: DISKCHECK

	It is useful for 2 primary types of situations:

	     * Directory Damage
	     * Using A Block Editor on a Disk

	For most uses, just boot the disk and give it the DEVICE NAME of the disk you
	wish to check. (i.e. .PROFILE).

	You will be asked where to send the information.  That should probably NOT be
	to your printer.  That's because DISKCHECK generates a lot of information
	needed only if you plan to use a block editor on the file.

	The program starts by displaying detailed block locations for each item in
	the directories on the file.  Then it displays information concerning the
	overall status of the directories. IF THERE IS DIRECTORY DAMAGE on the
	device, AND there have not been overwrites (i.e. files written partially
	over other ones), DISKCHECK will ask if you want it to FIX your directories.
	If you say YES, it will fix the directories.

	If there are files which have written-over parts of other active files,
	(THIS IS RARE), you will definitely lose some data.  But if you know
	something about file formats and how to use a block editor you can save most
	of them.

	As for block editors, you might want to try the one written by TAU's Dan
	Wade, which includes information about SOS directory format structure. This
	block editor is available thru WAP as is Daryl Anderson's Disk Window+.


	SIDE TWO: PROHEALTH

	This quick little program has no options. After booting, it displays one
	screen of very useful information concerning your profile. It tells its
	name, total number of blocks, number of blocks which have gone bad and number
	of spare blocks that are still available on the device, as well as number of
	normal blocks available (not written yet).

	This can diagnose whether your disk is about to go bad!

	PDS NAME : Vindicator and Fixer
	DISK ID  : III.REP.08
	BOOTABLE : Both Sides


	ON SIDE ONE:

	"VINDICATOR" is another RAM memory test program.  It's a DOS-based program
	that will boot on your /// and is copyable - but not listable (use Copy //+
	if you want to look at the code level).  VINDICATOR will work on any ///
	up to 512K of memory.  If you think you're having a RAM problem, run
	VINDICATOR overnight for best results.  Does NOT give you a running count
	of home many runthroughs made.

	ON SIDE TWO:

	FIXER.0001

	  This program is intended to be used in emergency situations that arise
	  from catastrophic failures to your CATALYST SYSTEM.  The purpose is to
	  allow you to use your ORIGINAL disk as a boot disk, after it has been
	  LOCKED by the CATALYST installation procedure.

	  This program UNLOCKS the ORIGINAL disk in such a manor that it can be
	  reinstalled into CATALYST by reusing the installation procedure provided
	  with CATALYST.

	  After executing this program from Menu.Maker simply boot the floppy disk
	  and use it as you normally would without the CATALYST SYSTEM.

	PDS NAME :  BLOCK EDITOR AND BLOCK BYTER
	DISK ID  :  APPLE-3-WAP-REP-09
	BOOTABLE?   BOTH SIDES


	SIDE ONE: BLOCK EDITOR

	     This program allows you to change the contents of any block on a block
	device.  Use it carefully, since making the wrong change on a diskette can
	render it unreadable.  For demonstration purposes we suggest you use a
	scratch diskette.

	D)evice      Set the device where the next read/write will take place.
	             Usually it will be '.D1', '.D2',  etc.

	B)lock       Sets the block number for the next read/write.  Usually 0-279.

	R)ead        Reads in the block specified by 'device' and 'block'.

	W)rite       Writes to the block specified by 'device' and 'block'.

	L)ist        Lists out the contents of the last block read.  Press any
	             key to stop the listing.

	C)hange      Changes the contents of a block that has already been read.
	             'Value CR' = change value,  'CR' = done changing,
	             'Space bar' = skip to next value


	SIDE TWO: BLOCKBYTER

	The BlockByter program contains two major segments:

	(1) The Block Editor allows you to read, edit, and print information in any
	block of a SOS, ProDOS, or DOS 3.3 disk.

	(2)  The Cat Fixer attempts to recover files whose directories are damaged or
	overwritten

	.
	THE BLOCK EDITOR:  displays the information in each block as text and as
	hexadecimal numbers.  You may edit only the hexadecimal side of the screen.
	The program will write the changed block to the disk, read the revised block,
	and display it for verification.

	Note:  You can edit ONLY the hexadecimal side of the screen.  The text side
	will not reflect your edits until the program reads the revised data from
	the disk.  Therefore, it's a good idea to P)rint the block before editing. If
	you make an error in your hexadecimal math you'll have a hard copy of the
	original block.}


	CAT FIXER:  The Cat Fixer segment of the program works only with SOS or
	ProDOS disks.  It identifies each map on a disk, reads the blocks on that
	map, and writes them to a new file on a new disk.  Cat Fixer can restore text
	files on a disk whose directory was erased by a power surge, but it has also
	restored files when the original directory entry was replaced by the entry of
	a new file. In such cases, programs like Lazarus cannot restore the file, for
	they read the disk directory to find and restore the file.  Cat Fixer uses
	only the map blocks of the disk.

	Do not use Cat Fixer as anything but a last resort, however.  Because the
	program doesn't consult the directory, it doesn't know what kind of file it's
	copying.  Every file produced by Cat Fixer is an ASCII file, for that's the
	most common file type.  If your copied file doesn't work, use Pascal's A)lter
	command to change the file type.

	Cat Fixer requires a blank formatted disk in Drive 2 and your original
	damaged disk in Drive 1.  (The program tells you when to switch disks.)
	Finally, you can specify the range of blocks which Cat Fixer should search
	for maps.

	SIDE ONE:

	Dr. Jeppson's Pascal program that will disassemble the Apple /// memory or
	any Apple /// file to its assembly language roots.  For Advanced users only.

	To Use on a Hard Disk:

	      Place all code files and data files under one sub-directory on your
	      hard disk with the name : 'DISASSEMBLER'. Pascal text files
	      are not needed.

	      This program can be used with disk drives, but it is a pain!!

	      Additional notes 02/01/86

	      This version of the Jeppson Disassembler contains the CREATE.CODE
	      program that can take a disassembled Jeppson file and turn it into a
	      compilable source.text file for the ///'s assembler.  The program used
	      after you have successfully disassembled a file.  The program is self
	      documenting, so just follow the instructions.

	PDS NAME: TICKTOCK
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-REP-11
	BOOTABLE? Both Sides


	        "TICKTOCK" is a small DOS 3.3 -based utility that will help you
	properly set your Apple /// clock.  If you have a clock chip installed, it
	will simply tell you whether it is going too fast - or too slow.  If you have
	a problem, you can easily fix it yourself.

	WHAT YOU"LL SEE

	        To use TICKTOCK, simply insert the disk and reboot your system.
	The program is DOS-based and includes the software on disk to turn on
	the Apple // emulation mode.
	        Once booted, at the top of the screen, you'll see:

	                    APPLE /// CLOCK CALIBRATION TEST

	        Just below it will be:

	                    1 Second Test               (a number)

	        You'll hear a "clock" ticking in the background throughout.

	        Actually that's it.  The "1 Second Test" will give you a number
	that is either + or -.; presumably your clock is either too fast or too slow
	based on that number, and should be adjusted accordingly.

	HOW TO ADJUST YOUR CLOCK

	      The clock adjustment "pot" is located on the motherboard just next
	to the clock chip.  You can get at it by taking off the cover of your
	keyboard and unscrewing the four screws holding the keyboard to the chassis.
	Lift it up and away from you, resting against the Apple /// case (still
	connected to the motherboard with the ribbon cable.) The pot is approximately
	under the "L" key and can be adjusted with a small (thin) flat-head
	screwdriver.
	        I tried this on my ///+ and started with a 1 Second Test of +75.
	Adjusting the pot, I was able to get it down to +21.  I would have to say
	the best you can do is get it as close to "0" as you can.

	THE ALTERNATIVE WAY IS TO:

	        Use Business Basic to run this program:

	10 VPOS=20:HPOS=10:Print TIME$;:GOTO 10

	       This will give you a continuous time print-out on screen, allowing you
	to adjust the clock potentiameter against a time source of your choosing.
	(Again - you'll have to have a clock chip installed and used System
	Utilities, Desktop Manager, Powerkeys or a Basic or Pascal program to set
	the proper time to start with.)

	In Washington DC, you can call the Naval Observatory for the atomic clock.
	That number is (202)-653-1800.

	The short program above is on this disk side for your convenience and can be
	run from Menu.Maker (you'll have to hit <CONTROL>+ "C" to end and then at
	the
	")" prompt type "Run Menu.Maker" to return to MM.

	ENDING

	        To stop the program, press the <RESET> and <ESCAPE> keys at
	the same
	time.  You'll be returned to the familier "INSERT DISK AND REBOOT" message.


	MORE CLOCK INFORMATION:

	        We've included a Three EZ Pieces data base on this disk listing
	all our PD disks with Apple /// clock-related files (CLOCK.PD). Another Data
	Base (CLOCK.ARTICLES) lists articles you might be interested in from past
	years.

	FINALLY

	        Let the /// SIG know if you have any success with TICKTOCK and if you
	have any suggestions for using it.  A ThreeWorks Database search turned up
	no articles or even mention of this program. Nor was there a mention even
	in the Apple /// Technical Reference Manual. TICKTOCK was found in the PD
	library of our old friend Joe Dobrowolski of Apple Users Group International
	fame.

	PDS NAME: DIRECTRAN BY DROB:
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-REP-12
	BOOTABLE? BOTH SIDES

	          The purpose of DIRECTRAN is to protect the root directory of your
	hard disc.  Loss or unreadability of same for any reason is a major
	catastrophe as it renders the entire disc useless.  DIRECTRAN transfers the
	root directory blocks of the hard disc to another location (on a floppy
	disc).  If needed, these blocks can then be transferred to the proper
	location on the hard disc, restoring the root directory.  It might be wise to
	make DIRECTRAN part of your shut down procedure so that the directory you
	save is current.  DIRECTRAN requires the invoking of both REQUEST and BLOCK
	invokables.  The program is self-explanatory.


	SIDE TWO:  DISK /// SPEED TEST

	        Disk /// Speed Test will test the speed of your internal disk drive.
	It is one of those "special" DOS 3.3/Integer Basic disks that will boot
	directly on your ///, but cannot be listed (except as noted below).  You can
	make copies with System Utilities but not with Desktop Manager's Disk Manager
	utility.
	        You can read this disk in Apple //e emulation (with the Titan ///+//e
	cards) with Copy //+... which shows there are actually four Integer Basic
	programs along with their associated  Binary files.  They are: Quick Disk
	Test; Read Write Test; Quick Seek Test and Speed Test.
	        The Disk Motor Speed Adjust Program was written by WOZ himself for
	the Apple // and adapted for the ///.

	        As run, the disk is actually made up of three tests:

	        1) Read/Write Function Test
	        2) Apple /// Quick Trak Test
	        3) Disk Motor Speed Adjust Program

	        1)  This part of Disk /// Speed Test will write to and then read
	            from traks 28 through 34.  It will make two passes per trak.
	            IF everything is OK it moves on to...

	        2)  The Apple /// Quick Trak Test which lists in two rows all
	            the traks on your disk.  Row 1 is 0 to 17. Row 2 is 18 to 34.
	            It checks off each track bottom to top in Row 1 and top to
	            bottom in Row 2.  IF everything is OK it moves on to:

	        3)  The Disk Motor Speed Adjust Program which tells you whether
	            the internal drive is too fast, too slow or just right. It will
	            look like this:


	            SLOW                  NORM                 FAST
	           (-100)                  0                  (+100)
	                                   ^
	                                   |
	                                (YOURS)
	                               (+/-    )

	            Under "YOURS" you'll see the speed of your drive being
	            registered with +'s or -"s.

	        You can adjust the speed by adjusting the small potentiomenter on the
	smaller circuit board at the back of the disk drive.  It is accessable if you
	take off your SARA's top cover and the aluminum cover on top of the disk
	drive.  Try to get it as close to "0" as possible.
	        You can also adjust other disk drives with a little extra work -
	open up your /// from the bottom, unplug the internal drive and plug in the
	external.
	        To exit the program, simply press "Escape", which will take you into
	Integer Basic (NOW you can list this disk and see all the files mentioned
	above, load and list them.)

	        Many thanks to Paul Campbell for contributing this program to our
	PD!

	BOOTABLE? NOT Bootable


	GrafixWorks is a set of two double-sided disks that include a number of Apple
	/// Fotofiles you can use to help in designing, drawing and producing your own
	graphics.  There are a number of templates, drawing aids and even a few examples
	to help you.

	TO USE GRAFIXWORKS YOU WILL NEED AN APPLE /// OR ///+ COMPUTER, DRAWING PROGRAM
	AND PRINTER.  YOU MAY ALSO WISH TO HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER GRAPHICS AND FONTS.

	THIS IS A SHAREWARE PRODUCT.  PLEASE FOLLOW DISK INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU CHOOSE TO
	USE THESE DISKS.

	THE FILES

	All of the Fotofiles on these disks were made using On Three's Graphics Manager.
	It allows you to do a tremendous amount of work with graphics and print them out
	easily and quickly.  Used with On Three's Draw On ///, the PD program Sketchpad,
	or any other Apple /// or Apple // graphics program (up to Double HiRes), it is
	a powerful tool you can use for a number of projects.

	Here's what this disk contains:


	Side One          EXPLANATION

	DOTS1             Square "dots" equally spaced; partial screen
	DOTS2             Dots equally spaced full screen
	GAME.BOX          A Square with cross-hairs
	GRID              A Grid
	NOTE.LINES        Lines for notes
	TIC.TAC.TOE       A giant Tic Tac Toe Template
	TIC.TAC.TOE2      A number of smaller Tic Tac Toe Templates on one screen

	Side 2             EXPLANATION

	BLANK.LABELS       A template with six label boxes ready for your designs
	EXAMPLES
	 LETTERHEAD.1      One example of a letterhead design using Graphics Manager
	 LETTERHEAD.2      Variation on Letterhead.1
	 TCP.LABEL         Example of a label design using Blank.Labels
	PAPER.TEMP         First of three templates useful for design work
	PAPER.TEMP2        Second template useful for design work (with graph lines)
	PAPER.TEMP3        Third of three templates useful for design work
	TEMPLATE.BOX       Adaptation of Paper.Temp for drawing/designing purposes

	Many of these designs were inspired by Broderbund's Printshop (tm) program for
	the Apple //.  But the designs work just as well for you in /// mode.  Use them
	for ideas, adapt them to your own use or use them as is.

	For example, the Tic.Tac.Toe file can be printed out full size to play the game.
	Or use Tic.Tac.Toe2 for a number of games on one page. Capture one tic tac toe
	square and copy it across the top or bottom of a page as part of a letterhead
	design or as a border.  The Wicker borders can also be used in a number of ways.
	It's all up to your imagination!

	The GrafixWorks PaperTemplates can be used to help you with your graphics
	development.  There's a Blank.Labels file you can load, place it into the Paper
	Template of Graphics Manager and then load graphics and fonts to develop a
	custom label you can capture and copy to each of the six boxes before printing
	them out.

	PDS NAME: DAR:  DISK ARCHIVAL/RETRIEVAL Utility
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-SHR-08
	BOOTABLE? SIDE ONE

	November, 1993


	** SHAREWARE - SHAREWARE - SHAREWARE - SHAREWARE - SHAREWARE - SHAREWARE **


	Bob Consorti has done it again!  Here's the lowdown on his new SHAREWARE
	utility called "DAR":


	I spent my turkey day coding a new Apple /// utility.  I wrote it to fill two
	specific purposes.  First off the program is called DAR - short for Disk
	Archiver Retriever.  It allows you to archive a disk and store the archive
	file on your hard disk.  I'm big on functionality so I wrote it so it would
	also allow you to retrieve the archive and make a new floppy disk from the
	archive contents.

	The first purpose it fills is that you can now eliminate those bulky stacks
	of floppy disks and store backup/archive copies on your hard disk.  Note that
	the program will not copy blocks that aren't used by the files on the disk so
	you will get compressed disk images, rather than 140K files.  So for a disk
	with 30K of programs/whatever the size of the file will be about 32K.  The
	extra space comes from overhead.

	The second and most important reason I wrote the darn thing is that until now
	there was no easy way of sending (by modem) a lot of files.  You could use
	The Communications Manager's Binary II feature to send a batch of files at
	once but it's always a pain in the neck and doesn't handle sparse files.

	With DAR for the Apple /// you can now transmit any file and any 5.25" disk
	by archiving it and then sending just the one archived file.

	I think this will help out the die-hards still using the Apple /// and rather
	than making it a commercial program I'm releasing it as SHAREWARE with a $20
	requested contribution to the "Help Bob Pay His Rent" fund.

	Send your $20.00 Shareware payment to:

	PDS NAME : SOS DRIVERS
	DISK ID #: APPLE-3-WAP-SYS-07
	BOOTABLE?  Not Bootable


	This disk contains many of the driver files still available for the Apple
	///.  You'll need to use System Utilities (Disk APPLE-3-WAP-SYS-02) and its System
	Configuration Program to create a customized SOS.DRIVER file for your
	computer.

	On Side Two of this disk you'll find some SOS.DRIVER files already set up for
	you.  They are by no means complete and may not match the configuration you
	have.  We have set them up, however, to give you a start at setting up your
	system.  In any case, there are drivers on this disk that will work with many
	of the devices still available (new or used) to hook up to your Apple ///.

	If the SOS.DRIVER files set up on Side Two do NOT match your system
	configuration needs, you can use them as the basis for putting together a
	SOS.DRIVER file that will work.

	If you bought your system used, the odds are excellent that the former user
	has already set up his programs with a SOS.DRIVER that works with that
	system.  In that case, you can use a SOS.DRIVER file from one of the boot
	disks you received and use it as the basis for adding additional drivers when
	you need to (for example, adding a trackball driver, graphics driver,
	hard disk driver, or additional printer driver.)

	For more information on how to set up your SOS.DRIVER file using the System
	Configuration Program (SCP) in System Utilities, please see the file on this
	disk named DRIVER.CONFIG.  If you were lucky enough to get an original set of
	Apple /// manuals, there is information there as well. There is one other
	source, of course: your /// SIG.  We have a number of books in the WAP
	library as well as video and audio tutorial tapes available for take-out.  If
	you are still having trouble, feel free to come to one of our SIG meetings,
	usually held quarterly, at the WAP office.

	Below is a listing of the SOS.DRIVERS on Side Two. If you decide to use one
	of them, you will have to use System Utilities to rename the file (that is,
	take off the number designation at the end).


	SOS.DRIVER1:  .CONSOLE                    (This is the minimum required
	                                           to operate an Apple ///.)

	SOS.DRIVER2:  .CONSOLE
	              .PRINTER (SERIAL PORT:SERIAL PRINTER)

	SOS.DRIVER3:  .CONSOLE
	              .PRINTER (SERIAL CARD IN SLOT 1)
	              .PROFILE (HARD DISK: CONTROLLER CARD IN SLOT 4)

	SOS.DRIVER4:  .CONSOLE
	              .PRINTER (SERIAL PORT: SERIAL PRINTER)
	              .PROFILE (HARD DISK: CONTROLLER CARD IN SLOT 4)

	              .PRINTER (PARALLEL PRINTER: CARD IN SLOT 1)

	              .GRAFIX  (GRAPHICS DRIVER FOR GRAPHICS PROGRAMS)

	will have to use the SCP program in System Utilities to designate slots for
	some of these (the driver needs to know where the card is to talk to it.):

	Originally a commercial program by Gary Kato, XMODEM /// is
	a wonderful telecom program that gives ///ers access to the XMODEM
	protocol with Binary II option. It's a way of uploading or downloading all
	types of files without fear of errors.

	XMODEM /// has several major features:

	XMODEM /// can be used as an ordinary TTY ASCII terminal for most
	telecommunications needs;

	In the ASCII terminal mode, XMODEM /// allows you to both
	download and upload ASCII text files of your choosing;

	XMODEM /// is able to use a variety of bit settings, baud rates,
	half or full duplex, linefeed and line delays;

	XMODEM /// allows you to use the XMODEM protocol, a powerful
	telecommunications protocol that is highly coordinated and
	extremely accurate;

	In the XMODEM receive mode, XMODEM /// allows you to both
	download and upload any file as an ASCII text file in binary
	format for later conversion;

	And, XMODEM /// features the new BINARY II option for Apple file
	transmission.  You now can literally send and receive SOS or
	ProDOS files intact and ready to use!

	XMODEM /// may be run on diskettes or installed under CATALYST or
	SELECTOR ///.

	INFONET is an information network software program written for novice to
	expert computer users.  INFONET was designed for people who need a method of
	electronic communications between themselves and other computer users.

	INFONET is an easy to use program and has applications for vast numbers of
	organizations.  Examples of effective usage include:

	 -  Retail stores who link with customers and sales people
	 -  Computer user group communication
	 -  School districts communicating with individual schools
	 -  Cottage industry marketing and customer communications
	 -  Any group of computer users for electronic communications


	INFONET was originally sold by Sun Remarketing of Logan, Utah.  In 1987, it
	was placed into the public domain.  It was greatly enhanced
	by Ed Gooding and Walt Pawley and was used for many years (through 1994)
	as the BBS system for the old ///s Company BBS (files donated to WAP).


	SIDE ONE includes Source Code files and the User.Manual file. Our Basic
	version of Menu.Maker is on this disk if you wish to look from another
	Basic disk and read the manual. Print.All is also available to print all
	Text files on this disk (Applewriter or other word processor can also
	be used to read the text files).

	SIDE TWO includes the actual program itself.

	Not Self-Booting.  Users with knowledge of Pascal recommended.

	Apple's Original Description:

	ACCESS 3270 is a versatile and user-friendly package that allows
	your Apple /// to access any computer that supports IBM 3270 communications.
	Works exclusively with an Apple 3270 Cluster Controller that rounds out a
	complete,  interactive communications solution  (NOTE: Also works with a
	Modem - Please see the Weber Baker review on this disk). Emulates operation
	on an IBM 3270 keyboard and also gives you reconfiguration options.  Can
	transfer text files to and from a host computer.  Supports comprehensive
	command file capability which provides for auto-dial and auto-log-on
	capabilities.  Provides customized 3270 help screens, ability to filter
	control to and from host, and quick reference keyboard templates. Requires
	phone jack, Apple 3270 Cluster Controller Emulator (or a modem) and an
	applications interface program on the host computer.


	ON SIDE ONE:

	The.Menus     : A file containing the menu files found within Access 3270.
	Read.Me.First : This file.
	Review        : A tutorial/review of Access 3270 by Weber Baker, as
	                published in Frank Moore's Three Magazine of Feburary, 1987.
	                The magazine is no longer published.

	        All the files can be read or printed under Menu.Maker (which is the
	program that Side One boots into.) We've also included a program called
	Print.All which will print ALL ASCII (text) files on this disk easily and
	quickly.


	SIDE TWO

	A bootable copy of Apple Access 3270.  The program is copyable and you can
	place it on your hard disk under BOS3, Selector or Catalyst.The program looks
	and works remarkably like Access ///, the terminal program for the Apple ///
	(little wonder - Apple simply adapted Access /// to make this program...)

	Files include: SOS.KERNEL; SOS.DRIVER; ACS3FONT; AUTOLOG; SOS.INTERP; CONFIG;
	               TERMREC

	PDS NAME: TerminALL Manual/Program
	Disk ID: APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-12 & 13
	BOOTABLE?: Bootable (both disks)

	TerminALL is the third program placed into the Public
	Domain by Foxware, Inc. of Salt Lake City, UT.  TerminALL is a
	telecommunications program designed to emulate any number of popular
	terminals, including the DEC VT100 series.

	Disk APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-12 contains the manual for the program and is self-booting.
	Disk APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-13 offers the actual TerminALL Program Disk - in self-booting
	Pascal.


	SOME IMPORTANT NOTES FOR TERMINALL USERS


	       TerminALL  is  an  interesting  telecommunications program, but it has
	one  major problem.  It can not upload or download!  It was primarily
	designed to  allow the Apple /// to emulate any of a series of terminals and
	apparently the   authors  did  NOT  think  uploading  or  downloading  was
	important  or necessary.
	       As  such,  this  program  is  basically  worth  using  by  a  beginner
	interested  in  learning how to use a program that can connect a computer
	with a computer  service  like  CompuServe, Genie or Source or a BBS, like
	the WAP Telecommunications System.  TerminALL can be set for different baud
	rates and protocals,  as  with other telecommunication programs.  We would
	recommend you read  the  manual carefully to familiarize yourself with its
	operation.  If you want  to connect to a BBS or telecom service like
	CompuServe, you can probably use  any  of  the  available terminal modes.
	But the default mode, VT52  is a standard  that  will  serve  you  well if
	all you wish to do is "get your feet wet" in the wonderful world of
	telecomputing.
	        Despite  it's  rather  glaring  negatives, TerminALL is a
	well-written program  that  works with few, if any problems.  It is easy to
	learn and use.  The  WAP  /// SIG again thanks FOXWARE Products for placing
	TerminALL into the public domain for all to use.

	AUGUST, 1989 NOTE:

	        Since this was written, the /// SIG has placed a number of other
	telecom programs and information into the PD library.  Check out disks
	APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-04 or APPLE-3-WAP-TEL-05.  Please also note there are a number of information files
	on both sides of this disk.  Information on other telecom programs, vendors,
	etc.  all are ASCII (Text) files and can be read from Menu.Maker or using the
	program PRINT.ALL on this disk. You can also load these files into any Apple
	/// (or //) word processing program.

	ADDITIONAL NOTE

	The  PASCAL  source code to this program is available from your SIG
	leadership if  you  are  a  programmer  wishing  to  take a look at how
	TerminALL was put together  and/or adapt it to your own needs.  Any
	contributions to the SIG PD library welcome!

	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-UTL-03
	BOOTABLE? SIDE ONE ONLY


	By

	David Ottalini
	WAP /// SIG CO-Chairman


	        A3 REBOOT will let you reboot any program from .D1 with just the
	press of the RETURN key.  The program can do this because its a specially
	prepared version of SELECTOR ///, the hardisk utility program sold by On
	Three.
	        Selector has a "hook" in it, so that when a program ends it doesn't
	take you to the "INSERT DISK AND PRESS CONTROL-RESET" message.  Instead,
	it brings you back to a menu, from which you can then select the next
	application you desire.
	        This version will only allow you to reboot a disk from .D1.  But
	it will give you an idea of what SELECTOR can do.  If you'd like more
	information about Selector and On Three's entire line of programs, you
	can call them at 1-805-822-8580. Their address is 1174 Hickory Ave. in
	Tehachapi, California. Zip is 93561
	        You are currently reading this file from side one of disk APPLE-3-WAP-UTL-38.
	It also includes some additional articles about Selector and a database of
	all articles pertaining to Selector /// (as compiled by the author using
	his THREEWORKS information disks).
	        Side Two contains A3 REBOOT/Selector ///.  Remember to replace our
	SOS.DRIVER file with yours so your system is configured properly.
	As always, your comments and suggestions are most welcome.


	                                                        May 8, 1992

	** May 1995 NOTE:

	If you like Selector /// -  you'll really want to try BOS3 - the new upgrade
	to SOS that includes a built-in program selector among many other features.
	Best of all for Selector users is that BOS3 uses the same pathname structure
	- one that you already know and have used.  For more information, contact
	the WAP office. BOS3 is available from WAP for just $50.00. (all funds go
	into a special Software Development Fund for the ///).

	BOOTABLE? Side One


	        The Epson Screen Printer will work with any Epson or Epson-
	compatable printer (like the Panasonic series) and is designed to let
	the user print text or graphics screens in several different modes.
	        The program was written by Rick Sidwell and originally marketed
	by Alpine Computing, Inc., the precursor to Sun Remarketing.  It has not
	been offered for sale for many years and thus we are happy to place it into
	the Public Domain for anyone interested.


	On Side One you will find:

	MANUAL         : Epson Screen Printer Manual
	READ.ME        : The file you are currently reading
	EPSON.PRINTERS : An AppleWorks/3EZ Pieces DB file containing a bibligraphy
	                 of articles about Epson printers and the Apple ///.
	                 (Taken From ThreeWorks for the Apple /// (c) 1995 David
	                 Ottalini - Shareware)


	On Side Two you will find the Epson Screen Printer Program.  It is
	self-booting under Business Basic and includes a Demo program for you to
	try out on your printer.  Note that we have replaced the orginal SOS.DRIVER
	file with one that will allow you to print from the Apple ///'s RS232
	(Serial) printer.  If you have a parallel printer, there is an Epson driver
	in the SOS.DRIVER file you can make Active using the System Configuration
	Program of System Utilities (or simply replace the SOS.DRIVER file with one
	you know works with your Epson or Epson-compatable printer.

	PDS NAME: Jeppson Codefile Utility
	DISK ID : APPLE-3-WAP-UTL-05
	BOOTABLE? BOTH SIDES


	By David Ottalini
	   WAP /// SIG Co-Chairman


	This is a Business Basic program that will allow you to change the filetypes
	of your Apple /// files.  All the necessary invokables and documentation are
	available on disk for you.  Dr. Jeppson was an early supporter of the /// and
	wrote many of the most interesting programs we have.  He was a mainstay in
	the old Softalk Magazine. I'll bet he's a pretty good dentist too...

	Side One includes a tutorial in Basic you can run using Menu.Maker.  It will
	allow you to print out some of the material.  Side two includes the actual
	program (in Basic) and necessary Invokables.  The programs have been adapted
	to run with Menu.Maker.

	The filetypes available using this program include:

	File Type/#             Description

	$00       0             Typless File
	$01       1             Bad Block File
	$03       2             Pascal Code File
	$03       3             Pascal Text File
	$04       4             ASCII Text File
	$05       5             Pascal Data File
	$06       6             General Binary File
	$07       7             Font File
	$08       8             Graphics Screen File
	$09       9             Business Basic Program File
	$0A       10            Business Basic Data File
	$0B       11            Word Processor File
	$0C       12            SOS System File
	$0D-$0E   13-14         SOS Reserved
	$0F       15            Directory File

	     These are the ones this particular program will not only read - but
	allow you to change.

	     But there are additional types - which now include those taken by Apple
	and various other Apple II developers:

	$15          Screen Library File
	$10          RPS Data File
	$11          RPS Index File
	$12          AppleFile Discard File
	$13          AppleFile Model File
	$14          AppleFile Report Format File
	$16-$18      SOS Reserved
	$19          AW/3EZP Data Base File
	$1A          AW/3EZP Word Processor File
	$1B          AW/3EZP Spreadsheet File
	$1C-$1F      Reserved
	$20          Global File (Desktop Manager)
	$25          Desktop Manager
	$26          Desktop Manager Option
	$27          Note Pad File (Desktop Manager)
	$28          Subload File (Desktop Manager)
	$29-$EE      Reserved
	$AB          GS Basic File
	$AD          GS Basic Data File
	$EF          Pascal Area
	$F0          ProDos Added Comment File
	$F1-$F8      ProDos User Defined Files 1-4
	$F9          ProDos Reserved
	$FA          Integer Basic Program File
	$FB          Integer Basic Variables File
	$FC          Applesoft Program File
	$FD          Applesoft Variable File
	$FE          Relocatable Code File (EDASM)
	$FF          ProDos System File

	        On Three's Communications Manager includes a utility that will allow
	you to change any filetype into any other.
	        Note, however,  that you need to be VERY careful when changing file
	types, since you can really make mash out of a file in moving it from one
	type to another (For example - you can't change a Basic file to ASCII and
	expect Applewriter to read it.) Make a copy and do the conversion on it just
	to be safe.  And as noted above, since the demise of the ///, Apple II
	developers have, on occasion, taken a /// filetype as their own, which could
	cause some problems if you're working with Apple II files.

	SOSTRAN is an Apple ///  utility that can transfer Pascal text files or SOS
	ASCII files to DOS text files. Or  it can move fonts from Apple // Pascal,
	Pilot or DOS tool kit to a SOS font file.   It  will  also  convert Applesoft
	and Integer Basic files to Pascal or Business Basic text files.

	As Frank Moore writes in the enclosed review:

	"SOSTRAN is most powerful for cataloging ][ disks, and in the transfer of
	text, data and font files."

	ON SIDE ONE:

	SOSTRAN.MANUAL   :   An edited but mostly complete transcription of the
	                     SOSTRAN Manual.

	SOSTRAN.REVIEW   :   A short review of the program by Frank Moore of "The
	                     Three Magazine."

	* Note that you can view and print either file with the included Menu.Maker
	  program or by using our "Print.All" program, which will print as many
	  text files from as many disks as you designate.

	ON SIDE TWO:

	The SOSTRAN boot and program (which is Pascal) files.  It can be placed on
	your hard disk and run from BOS3, Selector or Catalyst.
